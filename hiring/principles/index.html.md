## Principles of Hiring

We've intentionally crafted our hiring and recruiting practices to align with the GitLab culture, and we've outlined the foundational ethos that drives our talent ethos. These principles will guide our talent strategies and tactical employment and hiring decisions. We want to state up front that one of the advantages of being a remote company is that we can hire talent from anywhere, not just the San Francisco Bay Area. We want to ensure we finding the best talent the world has to offer. It may take more effort to find talent in more diverse places, but that is an effort we are willing to make.

## Collaboration

## Results

## Efficiency

## Transparency

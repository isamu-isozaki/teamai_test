## Technical interview<a name="technical-interview"></a>

For some positions, the hiring process includes a technical interview.

This technical interview revolves around a merge request to a small Rails
application created for the interview.

A day before the call, we will send you a link to the merge request and ask you
to spend up to 30 minutes of your time reviewing it, as you would for any
contribution to a project you were working on. The merge request is
self-contained, so you shouldn't need to look elsewhere in the project.

This technical interview is a 1-hour video call and screen sharing session with
the interviewer(s/index.html.md), where they will ask you to walk them through your review,
and where you will also write some code to improve the merge request.

## <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw icon-color font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Support Direction

The overall direction for Support in 2018 is set by our overall [strategic objectives](/strategy/index.html.md), with a particular emphasis on continued improvement of (Premium/index.html.md) Customer satisfaction. As can also be inferred from our [publicly visible OKR page](/okrs/index.html.md/index.html.md), the effort focuses on the following elements.

**Triaging Support Effort**

By triaging support effort through internal SLAs and integration of SalesForce, Zuora, and Zendesk, the team can improve the support experience for Premium customers while still addressing the questions of _all_ subscribers.

**Increase Capacity & Develop Experts**

In 2016 and 2017 we expanded the support team significantly, and this trend will continue in 2018. Along the way, the Support team developed internal training tools to assist in rapid, robust, self-guided training for any team member. As GitLab -- the product -- continues to expand, so will the skill and knowledge of all Support Engineers to be able to continue providing an excellent customer support experience.

Know someone who might be a great fit for our team? Please refer them to the [Support Engineer job description](/job-families/engineering/support-engineer/index.html.md).

**Actionable Analytics**

Better reporting on ticket metrics (topic, response times, product it relates to, etc./index.html.md) will help guide the Support Team's priorities in terms of adding to the greatest documentation needs, bug fixes, and support processes.

#### What if I Feel Threatened or Harassed While Handling a Support Request?
Just as Support Staff are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct, we also expect customers to treat the Support Staff
with the same level of respect.

If you receive threatening or hostile emails from a user, please create a confidential issue in the GitLab Support Issue Tracker
and include:

1. A history of the user's communication
1. Relevant links
1. Summary of the high-level issues
1. Any other supporting information

Include your Manager, Director of Support, Abuse Team and Chief Culture Officer in this issue. Together we will evaluate on a
case-by-case basis whether to take action (e.g. ban the user from the forums for violating the Code of Conduct/index.html.md).

## Our Meetings

Support has four meetings each week. These allow us to coordinate and help us all grow together. Each meeting has its own agenda and is led by a different member of the team each week.

|  Weekday  |   Region  |      Meeting Name     |                                        Purpose                                      |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  Tuesday  |    APAC   |      Support Call     |              Discuss metrics, demos, upcoming events, and ask questions             |
|  Tuesday  |    AMER   |  Ticket Crush Session |         Perform demos and cooperatively solve challenging tickets as a group        |
| Wednesday | AMER,EMEA | Dotcom Support Call | GitLab.com support team meeting to discuss metrics, demos, upcoming events, and ask questions |
|  Thursday  |    EMEA   |      Support Call     |              Discuss metrics, demos, upcoming events, and ask questions             |
|   Friday  | AMER,EMEA |      Support Call     |              Discuss metrics, demos, upcoming events, and ask questions             |

The regions listed above are the regions for which each call may be the most convenient, but all are welcome on any call. Every call is recorded and notes are taken on the agenda for each one. If you miss a meeting or otherwise can't make it, you can always get caught up.

All Zoom and agenda links can be found on the relevant calendar entry in the Support Calendar.

### Role of the Notetaker
The notetaker should take notes during the meeting and if action is required, create a comment and assign it to the appropriate person.

If the notetaker is not available when it is their turn, they should find a substitute.

### Role of the Chair
The main role of the chair is to start the meeting, keep the meeting moving along, and end the meeting when appropriate. There is generally little preparation required, but depending on the meeting, will include choosing a "feature of the week" or similar. Please check the agenda template for parts marked as "filled in by chair."

During the meeting, the chair:

* will ensure that each point in the agenda is covered by the listed person,
* may ask the team to move a discussion to a relevant issue when appropriate,
* cover [metrics in brief](#weekly-metrics-in-brief/index.html.md), and
* copy the agenda template for the following week and tag the next chair/secretary.

If a chair is not available, it is their responsibility to find a substitute.

#### Weekly Metrics in Brief
The links to the relevant ZenDesk views are in the agenda template, but can also be found under the `Reporting` tab in ZenDesk. Two areas to cover:

1. Satisfaction tab: Meeting our CSAT OKR?
1. Insights > Support SLAs: Meeting our SLA OKR?

Answers to questions, deeper insight, and analysis is not expected of the chair. Support Managers will cover metrics in more depth as needed.

## Cross Functional Meetings
As a result of our direct interactions with customers, the Support Team occupies a unique position in GitLab. As such we have standing meetings
across functions to help surface issues and smooth the interface between groups. If you're missing from this list (and want to be on it/index.html.md)
please let the Support Managers know in `#support-managers`

If you're on the Support Team and have something you'd like to surface, or would like to attend one of these meetings, feel free to post in `#support-managers`.

## Time Off
The Support Team follows [GitLab's paid time off policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/paid-time-off/index.html.md). However, do note that if a large number of people are taking the same days off, you may be asked to reschedule. If a holiday is important to you, please schedule it early.

In addition to the tips in [Communicating Your Time Off](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off/index.html.md) please also:
- add an event to the [**Support Time-off**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gitlab.com_as6a088eo3mrvbo57n5kddmgdg%40group.calendar.google.com/index.html.md) calendar with your name and a brief note, marked "free", and optionally inviting your manager
- ensure that you take steps to alert your availability in Calendly (either in the Calendly app, or by making meetings marked "busy" during your working hours/index.html.md)
- if you're on-call, make sure you have coverage and that PagerDuty is up to date
- reschedule any 1:1 meetings with your manager
- add an agenda item during the team meeting before your time off
- add an agenda item after you get back to let us know what you've been up to!

If you do not have access to the [**Support Time-off**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gitlab.com_as6a088eo3mrvbo57n5kddmgdg%40group.calendar.google.com/index.html.md) team calendar, please raise it in the `#support` channel on Slack and someone will share it with you.

## Additional Resources for the Support Team

### Breach Hawks

Breach hawks are members of the support team who help the rest of the team keep an eye out for nearly-breaching tickets, so that they can be responded to in a timely manner. Of course, any and all members of the Support Team will have a sense of how many tickets are close to breaching and how high the load is on any given day. But it can happen that you're deep into a ticket, a customer call, etc., unaware of the impending doom. That's where breach hawks come in: they tackle their tickets, but they also keep an eye out for the team at large and can call in the [Support Turbos](#support-turbo/index.html.md) when needed.

### Support Turbo

Every now and then, it may occur that we come close to breaching our SLAs. To prevent an actual breach from occurring, the Support team can call on the help of several "Support Turbo" developers who are denoted on the [Team Page](/team/index.html.md/index.html.md).

Anyone within the support team can call Turbos when there is a need for it. Turbos should be called by pinging specific people via Slack. If you are in doubt who is available, you can use `@turbos`, but this may lead to a bystander effect.

The support team calls for help when necessary via Slack. Support Turbos should treat requests to solve breaching tickets with high priority. If a Turbo is working on something that cannot wait (e.g. security release, critical regressions, direction issues with near deadlines/index.html.md), the Turbo should ensure that someone else fields the request for Turbos by checking with the development lead or VP of Engineering.

Further guidelines when rolling up your sleeves to do Turbo work:

- Turbos should attempt to pick up "single touch" tickets (though this is not always easy to recognize/index.html.md) whenever possible
- Since Turbos log in using a generic agent, there are some special considerations:
   - Pro-actively sign the tickets with your name, or leave an internal note so that the rest of the team knows which individual provided a response. This is helpful to be able to reach out and gain context, etc.
   - Do not [assign tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690956/index.html.md) to the generic agent account. Leave the assignee as the "group", otherwise these tickets will get lost.
   - Please remember that people may pick up any ticket after you've replied. Adding any issues, docs, or follow-up expectations for a reply as an internal comment would be really beneficial for the person picking it up after you.

## Contacting Support

### Internal Support for GitLab team members

Fellow GitLab team members can reach out for help from the Support Team in various ways:

1. For normal support questions ("Can GitLab do x?", "How do I do y with GitLab?"/index.html.md) try:
   - posing your question on the `#questions` channel in Slack, so that everyone can contribute to an answer. If you're not getting an answer, try cross-posting in the relevant support team channel.
1. For longer term or larger scope questions, such a process change, or data gathering requests, create a [support issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/issues/index.html.md)
1. If you have a user or account request that needs a GitLab.com administrator, please create an issue in the [dotcom internal requests tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/dotcom/dotcom-internal/index.html.md).
1. If customers or users have questions, advise them to contact support directly via the [support web form](https://support.gitlab.com/index.html.md).
1. As a last resort, ping the support team on the one of the support channels.

### Support Issue Tracker

The [Support project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/issues/index.html.md) hosts an issue tracker meant to improve our workflow by reporting any problems that may arise in our tools or processes. It's also meant to propose and discuss ideas in general.

The issue tracker is open to the community and part of the GitLab.com group. It should not contain any sensitive information. Links to Zendesk or other references are encouraged.

### Support Chat Channels

We use our chat internally as a realtime communication tool. The support channels are as follows:

- [#questions](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/questions/index.html.md) - If your question is something that you think anyone in the company could answer or is valuable to the greater company to know, ask it here!
- [#support-live-feed](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/support-live-feed/index.html.md) - Feed of all Zendesk related events
- [#services-live-feed](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CADGU8CG1/index.html.md) - Feed of all Zendesk related events for views that the GitLab.com Support team uses
- [#support_self-managed](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/support_self-managed/index.html.md) - This channel is specifically for coordination related to Self Hosted issues.
- [#support_gitlab-com](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C4XFU81LG/index.html.md) - This channel is specifically for the GitLab.com support team. They handle GitLab.com account and subscription support and GitHost.
- [#githost](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/githost/index.html.md) - This channel handles monitoring for GitHost instances.

In order to attract support team's attention in Slack, you can use the team handles, mentioning multiple team members in a message or a thread where support is needed. Support team handles are:
- `@support-selfmanaged` - Self-managed support team members.
- `@support-dotcom` - GitLab.com support team members.
- `@supportmanagers` - Support director and managers.

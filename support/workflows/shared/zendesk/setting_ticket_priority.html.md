## Setting Ticket Priority

Manually setting a ticket's priority in Zendesk will change the overall ticket [SLA](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/support/support-engineering/prioritizing-tickets.html#sla/index.html.md), for both the first and next replies. This allows support to prioritize the active ticket queue more effectively .

### Effect of Prioritization on SLA (non-premium customers/index.html.md)

| Priority | First/Next Reply - SLA (business hours/index.html.md) |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Low      |  16 hours                               |
| Normal   |  12 hours                               |
| High     |  8 hours                                |
| Urgent   |  4 hours                                |

### Prioritization Guidelines

+ Core GitLab functionality is not affected, and does not affect customer's work
+ Documentation related
+ General information questions
+ Feature requests

#### Normal

+ Minor problems
+ GitLab is not functioning correctly
+ Customers may be inconvenienced, but are able to continue working
+ Low impact on general GitLab usage

#### High

+ Major problems
+ Partial loss of GitLab functionality
+ Customer's ability to operate is seriously affected
+ High impact on GitLab usage

#### Urgent

+ Major emergencies only
+ Full loss of GitLab functionality, service is completely unavailable
+ GitHost (GitLab Hosted/index.html.md) instance down
+ Customers cannot continue to work at all

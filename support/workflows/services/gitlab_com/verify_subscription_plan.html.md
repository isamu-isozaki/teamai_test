### Overview
Many customers sign up for GitLab.com Subscription Plans and this guide will
tell you how to verify what a customer has subscribed to, explain upgrade paths
and how to process refunds.

---

### Verifying Subscription Status

#### Using customers.gitlab.com (recommended/index.html.md)

1. Sign in to [customers.gitlab.com](https://customers.gitlab.com/index.html.md) using the 
   support credentials in 1Password

1. Select **Customers** from the navigation on the left

1. In the **Filter** box, search for the customer using any of the criteria
   you got from the customer (name, company, etc./index.html.md)

   + If you don't find the customer this way, ask the customer for more 
     information about their account on customers.gitlab.com

1. On the right side of the customer's entry, you will see a lowercase **i**.
   Click on it to see lots of this customer's data.

   + On the new page you can find the Zuora and SalesForce accounts.

1. Click the **Impersonate** tab on the top of the page
1. On this new page you will see the customer's plan and its expiration date.

#### Using SalesForce

1. Sign in to [Salesforce](https://login.salesforce.com/index.html.md/index.html.md) using the support
   credentials in 1Password

1. At the top of the page, search for the user or company

1. Look under the **Accounts** category for a result.  Click on the **Account
   Name** that matches the company you're looking for.

1. Under **GitLab Subscription Information** look for the Purchased Products.
   You can also find the Next Renewal Date in this section.


### Upgrading an account
Customers may want to upgrade their accounts (e.g. from Bronze to Silver/index.html.md) to
access features not offered under their plan.

To process an upgrade:

1. Verify their current subscription status
1. In SalesForce, locate their account and find the *Account Owner*
1. Reply to the upgrade request ticket in ZD (or create a new one/index.html.md) and CC the
   account owner.

### Refunding an account

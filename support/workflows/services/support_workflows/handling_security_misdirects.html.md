##### Overview

Occasionally, users will reach out to security [at] gitlab [dot] com with questions that may be better addressed by Support (e.g., help resizing a repository in response to a mass notification/index.html.md).

##### Workflow

1. Open the ticket in ZenDesk. These are identified as having `Kwang` as the ticket requestor.
1. Depending on the content of the forward, you can usually change the requestor from `Kwang` to the user. Sometimes, it's preferable to create a new ticket. In either case, proceed as if it's a regular ticket from a user.
1. Often, these tickets will lack the name and email address of the user. You can usually find the original email by searching in the **#security-alert-manual** channel (everything emailed to security [at] is also shared there/index.html.md). Should that search turn up short, feel free to reach out to the individual who forwarded the ticket for this information.

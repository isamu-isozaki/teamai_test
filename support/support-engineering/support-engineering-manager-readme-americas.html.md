# Manager Readme - Lee Matos

+ As your manager, my goal is to find the intersection of what you want and what the department needs. I am always open to ideas and helping to carve out time for you to accomplish things you find important.

+ By nature, I end up being â€œthe manager I want to have.â€ I need to be more of the manager you want to have. Help me fulfill that by giving me feedback, and Iâ€™ll do what I can to make those changes.

+ Weâ€™ll host weekly 1-1s. This is your time to help me help you achieve what you want. Bring topics and ideas and Iâ€™ll happily help to scope them out so we can accomplish them. Iâ€™ll expect you to have your 1:1 doc ready before our meeting, and to lead that meeting.

+ I aim to provide actionable constructive feedback weekly during our 1:1â€™s. If you feel like you have a specific question or need clarity, feel free to ask!

+ My calendar is always open for team members. This is a great way to make sure you have my attention. Absolutely schedule some time with me and I will be there to talk about anything you want my ear for.

+ If you find me slow to respond or you need something urgently, you can ping me multiple times. I will not take offense.

+ I prefer slack based communication, so you will probably have your best results linking me to the thing you need me to comment on in slack.

+ Youâ€™ll often find me around at â€œweird timesâ€, this is because Iâ€™m managing a global team and I want to be available. I do not expect this of team members and if I ping you back at an â€œodd hourâ€ itâ€™s okay to wait until normal work time to respond.

+ I as a person do not enjoy vacation. You are not me. GitLab has a generous vacation policy and if you want to take time off, get it on the calendar, communicate it to the team, and I support it.

+ In the spirit of being transparent, here is my [2018 360 Feedback (GitLab Internal only/index.html.md)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yobs31mH9jAmuKayx_cuLpj58ig8Y0oW-ymjzvRRBeE/index.html.md/index.html.md) in it's entirety.

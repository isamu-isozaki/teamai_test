## How to respond to a ticket

### Smart Humans Provide Smart Support

We aim to hire smart people, and let them be smart. This means we try to offer sensible guidelines that will help, but avoid “scripts” or rigidity. Speak in your natural voice as you would to a peer at a conference. Obviously avoid unprofessional language, but you’ll want to match the customer’s tone. There is often a desire to “unify” by everyone speaking in a robotic tone:

> “Thank you for contacting support. We can help you with this. It looks like you are asking for help with resetting your password…” 

This dehumanizes us and we lose our best asset: _Support from a human._ When you speak more naturally it anchors that we are also real people and not “support minds as a service:”

> “Ah, sorry to hear that you lost your password. I’ve issued a password reset and you are good to go. In the future, you can use this link:
>
> <link>
>
> Let us know if there is anything else we can help with. “

### We Aren’t a Cannery (but we sometimes use canned goods)

At GitLab, we consider the elements of our responses carefully. If you find yourself 
wanting to use canned responses, or are saying the same things over and over, it's 
probably an opportunity to improve our process. That is, instead of creating a text 
expander asking for logs, take a step back. Is there something earlier in the 
experience of opening a support ticket that we could do to reduce the need for repetitive text?
There are times when it's appropriate to use formal language and canned replies, 
but those will be rare. Whenever we can we push towards empathy and humanity and automate and preload the process.

Consider this spectrum:

```
Request requires -- v
Pure process             |--------------------|----------------------|  Higher level thinking
Robotic Support Voice    |--------------------|----------------------|  Empathy and Humanity
Tone is -- ^
```

Be empowered: at GitLab Support we want humans with agency, not agents. If something feels broken, ask. 
If something feels inefficient, fix it. Everyone can _and should_ contribute.

### The Sandwich Method
When it comes to actually answering tickets, the sandwich method is a great 3 point 
guideline that will help you elevate your responses. A great customer reply will 
contain the following 3 things:

- What you need from them.
- Present a premise or hypothesis which explains your thoughts on why the requested items will help.
- An offer to continue helping.

For example, a customer might ask:

> “ My GitLab server appears to be slowing down. Can you help me?”

An _okay_ response is:

> “ Please send us over your production logs and we can use that to troubleshoot some more. “

Notice we asked for what we needed, and we’ll be able to help. Let’s make it great using the sandwich method:

> “It will be helpful to get as many logs as possible during the slowness to help us isolate the problem. You can find them in /var/log/gitlab (This is our ask)
> 
> Usually when we see slowness, it’s isolated to a specific part of the application. Can you help us narrow down the issue by outlining when you see things slow down? (This is our premise for them to reenforce our expertise.)
> 
> Once you send these over and help us understand how you are getting to the slow state we’ll be happy to help you dive in some more.” (This is us reassuring them we’ll help.)

We’ve asked for what we need early. Hit them with it, so they can start thinking
on it and if they stop reading right there, they didn’t miss the ask. We’ve given 
a hypothesis which is something for them to chew on and understand our vantage. 
We don’t want to _serve_ our customers we want to _partner_ with them. This is 
one way for them to see us as a peer vs. “support minds as a service.”

We then make sure to let them know _we are still here_ and will be when they come back. 

There will be times where you might need to add more or even apologize for something, 
but this method should be applicable to the majority of tickets and help us deliver excellence.

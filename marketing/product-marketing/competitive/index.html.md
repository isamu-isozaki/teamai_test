## What is competitive intelligence?
A function of [product marketing](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/product-marketing/index.html.md) is to perform market analysis and gather information about competitors to better position GitLab in our go-to-market efforts.

## Market analysis

## DevOps Tools
GitLab exists in an ecosystem of [DevOps tools](/devops-tools/index.html.md) and might need to interact with any number of these tools. Many have over-lapping capabilities, but that does not mean that we necessarily directly compete with them. A user would need to patch together multiple solutions from this list in order to get all the functionality that is built-in to GitLab as a [single application for end-to-end DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/index.html.md/index.html.md). Other places that list tools in various DevOps categories include [CA](https://assessment-tools.ca.com/tools/continuous-delivery-tools/en?embed/index.html.md), [XebiaLabs](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/index.html.md/index.html.md), and [CNCF](https://landscape.cncf.io/index.html.md/index.html.md)

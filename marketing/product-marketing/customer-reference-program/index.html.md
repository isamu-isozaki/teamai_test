## Customer Reference Program

The goal of our Customer Reference Program is to provide opportunities for customers to share their story on how GitLab has helped them overcome the challenges, blockers and pain points within their organizations.


The goals of the Gitlab Customer Reference Program include:
- **Credibility** -Reinforce our credibility as an end-to-end DevOps solution partner.
- **Shorten the sales cycle** - Having our advocates involved with sharing their story with potential sales, analysts and the marketplace can help potential sales close sooner
- **Increase Revenue** - A successful Customer Reference Program helps increase revenue by attracting new clients and increasing retention rates.
- **Customer Advocacy** - Encourage our customers to share their success stories with others who are learning about or evaluating GitLab.

### Customer Reference Types
Some examples of the types of assets we'd use as customer references once we have approval from the customer:
* Logo (The ability to name a company as a customer and use their logo in our marketing materials/index.html.md)
* Live sales reference (both calls and possible in-person/index.html.md)
* Website content
  * Case studies
  * Blog posts
  * Videos
  * Podcasts
  * Usage quotes
* Event speakers (At industry, third-party and company events/index.html.md)
* References for analysts and press
* Quotes (can be attributable with approval or anonymous/index.html.md)
* Anecdotes (short "snackable" stories, can be attributable with approval or anonymous/index.html.md) Read [GitLab's customer anecdotes](#customer-anecdotes/index.html.md).

### Customer Case Studies
The most recent customer case studies are found on the [GitLab customer's page.](https://about.gitlab.com/customers/index.html.md/index.html.md)
When we build case studies, we need to have quantifiable metrics and business value to help describe how GitLab helped a customer achieve a signficant business result.  Below are a sample of KPIs / dimensions we need to find in a good case study.

**Faster**
* Improved cycle time - the time it takes for an idea to reach production.
* More frequent deploys -  related to cycle time, but easier to measure

**Savings**
* Reduced IT spend - We reduced budget by x.   Or we saved $ with GitLab
* Improved efficiency - We shipped more features in the same time…

**Business Value**
* Increased revenue

**Better / Quality**
* Reduced defects / errors
* Reduced security issues/vulnerability
* Decrease of customer support calls

If a proposed customer case study doesn't have at least one metric to include, then we consider working with the account team to help identify a solid metric before building the case study.

#### Publishing to the website

1.	Start by creating a `.yml` file in `/data/case_studies` directory under Marketing site repo (www-gitlab-com project/index.html.md).
2.	Keep the name of file same as company name (this is not mandatory but it is easier to manage/index.html.md), for eg; if company name is "Foobar", create a file as `/data/case_studies/foobar.yml`.
3.	Once created, add contents of the file using this sample Case Study template, and then update the values of each property based on case study details, remember, do NOT change property names.
4.	Once this file is added, you'll need to restart marketing site server by first closing it using Ctrl+C and then running bundle exec middleman again.
5.	When the server is started, you can view generated Case Study page in your local instance of marketing site under the URL, for eg; http://localhost:4567/customers/foobar.
6.	Please note that you don't need to restart server again if you make any changes to foobar.yml file, this is required only when a new file is added to the `/data/case_studies` directory.

### Customer references collection

Today, we don't have a central collection for customer service, but we are starting to build one. For now we are capturing customer stories in an issue. If you have a customer story or anecdote [leave a comment on issue 1834](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/issues/1834/index.html.md).

To initiate a formal case study process, follow the process listed [here](https://about.gitlab.comhttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/marketing-sales-development/content/case-studies/index.html.md/index.html.md)

### Customer Anecdotes
Customer anecdotes are short, "snackable" customer stories. These can be used on a call or in a meeting to share a point about GitLab by validating it with the customer story. An anecdote can be a summary of a formal, attributable case study or just an anonymous story from a conversation you had with a customer. It's important to keep customers anonymous unless we have explicit approval to use their name.

**Remove the complexity of multi-tool environments**

A communications company recently shared how they built their technology stack. "GitLab checks so many boxes for us that we don't need other tools." The company then explained they they are operating with a team of 2 people because GitLab makes the environment so simple. They said another organization would probably have to employ 15 people to accomplish what they can. 

**Administrative overhead**

We hosted a dinner for customers and prospects to mingle with each other and share stories. When the topic of managing the DevOps toolchain came up, the Head of Risk at a large US bank mentioned that she had a team of 20 to keep SDLC tools running in her org. A GitLab customer, the managing director of a product group for a global investment management corporation said, "this is going to break your heart, but I have 1 guy that spends 25% time to keep GitLab up and going for my team of 1500 devs."

**Deliver value faster** 

Pinterest is not a GitLab customer, but uses Kubernetes together with Jenkins. Because there's no [native kubernetes integration](/kubernetes/index.html.md) for Jenkins they needed to dedicate a [team of 4 spending 6 months](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/pinterest/index.html.md/index.html.md) to build a custom system to control access managment and allow teams to to self-serve builds. This is functionality that comes out of the box on day one with GitLab. 

**Adoption at an incredible pace**

A large enterprise in the software space is a recent GitLab Premium customer wanting to replace Perforce. They predicted that it would take them 3 years to hit 6K active users. But, the developer experience was so superior that they ended up hitting 6K active users in only 8 months.

**Security is at the center**

A publishing firm is utilizing GitLab best of breed CI/CD functionality and with upcoming product advancements they have informed us that GitLab is a mission critical application for them. They also chose GitLab over the competition because security is currently the biggest aspect they want to improve on internally.

**Removing the wait**

A financial services company recently stated that their teams went from two week releases to six times per day using GitLab. They are able to release this quickly because they do not need to wait for infrastructure.

**No babysitter required**

An online gaming development house has a team of 9 looking after its toolstack for SDLC. GitLab is one of the tools in the stack, but is self-sufficient enough that they only deal with it every six months.

**Providing happiness everyday**

A large media company recently stated that GitLab is the best architected application they have ever used. According to this company, "This product is a joy to use. We cannot believe how much incremental value you crank out with each release."



### Customer Case Studies

Ticketmaster is a global event ticketing leader with one of the world's top five e-commerce sites, getting almost 27 million monthly unique visitors. Ticketmaster was using Jenkins for continuous integration. Weighed down by plug-ins and legacy development, their pipeline was taking 2 hours to complete.

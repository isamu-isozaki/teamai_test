## Analyst relations at GitLab

Analyst relations (AR/index.html.md) is generally considered to be a corporate strategy, communications and marketing activity, but at GitLab, because of our mission that everyone can contribute, we view the analyst community as participants as well. The primary owner of Analyst Relations at GitLab is Product Marketing, as they are the conduit between the analysts and the internal company information.  

Industry analysts usually focus on corporate or organizational buyers and their needs rather than on those of individual developers. At GitLab we view them as a marketing focus for those markets. They amplify our message to a different group than our traditional developer communities, although there is overlap to some degree between those communities.

## How we interact with the analyst community

Examples of how we engage with analysts include:
- Schedule briefings where we update analysts on our product, our company, our future direction and strategy;
- Answer questions for analyst reports such as Gartner MQs or Forrester Waves that provide in-depth information on product features, customer references and company information;
- Use analyst reports such as Gartner MQs or Forrester Waves that feature GitLab to help enhance or clarify our story for customers and partners;
- Provide our analyst newsletter to update analysts on what GitLab is doing between briefings;
- Schedule inquiries where analysts answer specific questions we have about products, markets, or strategies we want to understand better;
- Schedule consulting days for an extended dive with an analyst into products, markets, or strategies we are working on;
- Invite analysts to participate in webinars, speaking engagements, quotes for media, or other events where an analyst presence would be beneficial; and
- Hire analyst’s market research departments to help us create, run, and interpret survey research that helps us target markets or develop products optimally.

## Accessing analyst reports

Most analyst companies charge for access to their reports. 

-   If GitLab purchases reprint rights to a report, then that link will be available here, on the [Analyst Relations web page](https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/index.html.md/index.html.md), and on the relevant product page. Reprint rights are the rights to share the link to the report - these generally last six months to one year.
-   GitLab maintains relationships with some analyst companies that provide us with access to some or all of their relevant research. These reports are for internal use only and sometimes limited to named individuals.  Those reports are generally kept in an internal [GitLab folder for analyst relations](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oFmtmoXsbjMb6IuPIgIIZ-MG-tLfOjpw/index.html.md). If you are a GitLabber and you need access to a particular report, please reach out to [Analyst Relations](mailto:analysts@gitlab.com/index.html.md) and I'll help you find the research you need.

## Welcome to the Corporate Marketing Handbook
{:.no_toc}

The Corporate Marketing team includes Content Marketing, Corporate Events, PR, and Design. Corporate Marketing is responsible for the stewardship of the GitLab brand and the company's messaging/positioning. The team is the owner of the Marketing website and oversees the website strategy. Corporate Marketing develops a global, integrated communication strategy, executes globally, and enables field marketing to adapt and apply global strategy regionally by localizing and verticalizing campaigns for in-region execution. Corporate marketing also ensures product marketing, outreach, and marketing & sales development are conducted in a way that amplifies our global brand.

## Brand personality

GitLab's brand has a personality that is reflected in everything we do. It doesn't matter if we are hosting a fancy dinner with fortune 500 CIOs, at a hackathon, or telling our story on about.gitlab.com...across all our communication methods, and all our audiences, GitLab has a personality that shows up in how we communicate.

Our personality is built around four main characteristics.

1. Human: We write like we talk. We avoid buzzwords and jargon, and instead communicate simply, clearly, and sincerely. We treat people with kindness.
2. Competent: We are highly accomplished, and we communicate with conviction. We are efficient at everything we do.
3. Quirky: We embrace diversity of opinion. We embrace new ideas based on their merit, even if they defy commonly held norms.
4. Humble: We care about helping those around us achieve great things more than we care about our personal accomplishments.

These four characteristics work together to form a personality that is authentic to GitLab team members, and relatable to our audience. If we were `quirky` without being `human` we could come across as eccentric. If we were `competent` without being `humble` we could come across as arrogant.

GitLab has a [higher purpose](/strategy/#mission/index.html.md). We want to inspire a sense of adventure in those around us so that they join us in contributing to making that mission a reality.

## Style guide and tone of voice


The following guide outlines the set of standards used for all written company
communications to ensure consistency in voice, style, and personality across all
of GitLab's public communications.

See [General editorial style guidelines](#general-editorial-style-guidelines/index.html.md) for more.

### About

#### GitLab the community

GitLab is an [open source project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/index.html.md/index.html.md)
with a large community of contributors. Over 2,000 people worldwide have
contributed to GitLab's source code.

#### GitLab the company

GitLab Inc. is a company based on the GitLab open source project. GitLab Inc. is
an active participant in our community (see our [stewardship of GitLab CE](/stewardship/index.html.md)
for more information/index.html.md), as well as offering GitLab, a product (see below/index.html.md).

#### GitLab the product

GitLab is a single applicaiton for the complete DevOps lifecyle. See the
[product elevator pitch](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/product-marketing/#elevator-pitch/index.html.md)
for additional messaging.

### Tone of voice

The tone of voice we use when speaking as GitLab should always be informed by
our [Content Strategy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/blob/master/content/content-strategy.md#strategy/index.html.md).
Most importantly, we see our audience as co-conspirators, working together to
define and create the next generation of software development practices. The below
table should help to clarify further:


<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">We are:</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">We aren't:</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Equals in our community</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Superior</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Knowledgeable</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Know-it-alls</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Empathetic</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Patronizing</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l"></td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

We explain things in the simplest way possible, using plain, accessible language.

We keep a sense of humor about things, but don't make light of serious issues or
problems our users or customers face.

We use colloquialisms and slang, but sparingly (don't look like you're trying too hard!/index.html.md).

We use [inclusive, gender-neutral language](https://litreactor.com/columns/5-easy-ways-to-make-your-writing-gender-neutral/index.html.md).

## Updating the press page

**Updating the `/press/releases` page**
1. Create a new merge request and branch in www-gitlab-com
2. On your branch, navigate to `source` then `press` and click on the `releases` folder
3. Add a new file using the following format `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-press-release.html.md`
4. Add the following to the beginning of your document

---
layout: markdown
title: "Title of press release"
---

5. Add the content of the press release to the file and save. Make sure to include any links.

**Updating the recent news section**
1. Every Friday the PR agency will send a digest of top articles
2. Product marketing will update the `Recent News` section with the most recent listed at the top. Display 10 articles at a time. To avoid formatting mistakes, copy and paste a previous entry on the page, and edit with the details of the new coverage. You may need to search online for a thumbnail to upload to `images/press`, if coverage from that publication is not already listed on the page. If you upload a new image, make sure to change the path listed next to `image_tag`.
3. Move older content to the archive.

## Design

### Requesting design help

1. Create an issue in the corresponding project repository
    1. For tasks pertaining to [about.gitlab.com](/index.html.md/index.html.md) create an issue in the [www-gitlab-com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/index.html.md).
    1. For all other marketing related tasks create an issue in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/issues/index.html.md).
1. Add all relevant details, goal(s/index.html.md), purpose, resources, and links in the issue description. Also `@` mention team members who will be involved.
1. Set due date (if possible/index.html.md) â€ please leave at least 2 week lead time in order to genearte custom design assets. If you need them sooner, ping @luke in the #marketing-design slack channel and we will make our best effort to accomodate, but can't promise delivery.
1. Add the `Design` and `Website Redesign` (if applicable/index.html.md) label(s/index.html.md) to your issue.

### The `Design` label in issue tracker

The `Design` label helps us find and track issues relevant to the Design team. If you create an issue where Design is the primary focus, please use this label.

### Project prioritization

Per the Design team's discretion, the prioritization of design projects will be based on the direct impact on Marketing.

To get a better sense of [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/issues/index.html.md) prioritization, you can view the [Design Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/boards/273272/index.html.md). More specifically the `Design - Working On` and `Design - Top Priority` lists.

Design projects within the [www-gitlab-com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/index.html.md) can be tracked using the [Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Design/index.html.md) label. The prioritization of projects for [about.gitlab.com](/index.html.md/index.html.md) can be viewed on the [Website Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/boards/349137/index.html.md).

Any design requests that do not fall in line with the goals and objectives of Marketing will be given a lower priority and factored in as time allows.

### Design touchpoints

The Design team has a rather wide reach and plays a big part in almost all marketing efforts. Design touchpoints range from the [GitLab website](/index.html.md/index.html.md) to print collateral, swag, and business cards. This includes, but certainly not limited to:

#### Web & Digital
{:.no_toc}
- Redesign, updates, and maintenance of the [GitLab website](/index.html.md/index.html.md)
- Blog post covers & images
- Landing pages (campaigns, webcasts, events, and feature marketing/index.html.md)
- Swag shop (shop design and new swag/index.html.md)
- Presentation decks & assets
- Ad campaigns
- Email template design

#### Field Design & Branding
{:.no_toc}
- Marketing Design System
- Conference booth design
- Banners & signage
- Swag
- Event-specific slide decks
- Event-specific branding (e.g. GitLab World Tour, Team Summits, etc./index.html.md)
- Business cards
- One-pagers, handouts, and other print collateral
- GitLab [Brand Guidelines](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/brand-guidelines/index.html.md/index.html.md)

#### Content Design
{:.no_toc}
- Promotional videos & animations
- Social media campaign assets
- Webcast collateral & assets
- eBooks
- Whitepapers
- Infographics & diagrams

*In the spirit of 'everyone can contribute' (as well as version control and SEO/index.html.md) we prefer webpages over PDFs. We will implement a `print.css` component to these webpages so that print PDFs can still be utilized for events and in-person meetings without the headache of version control*

## Brand Guidelines

To download the GitLab logo (in various formats and file types/index.html.md) check out our [Press page](/press/index.html.md/index.html.md).

### The GitLab logo

The GitLab logo consists of two components, the icon (the tanuki/index.html.md) and the wordmark:

<img src="/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/gitlab-lockup.png" class="full-width">

GitLab is most commonly represented by the logo, and in some cases, the icon alone. GitLab is rarely represented by the wordmark alone as we'd like to build brand recognition of the icon alone (e.g. the Nike swoosh/index.html.md), and doing so by pairing it with the GitLab wordmark.

#### Logo safe space

Safe space acts as a buffer between the logo or icon and other visual components, including text. this space is the minimum distance needed and is equal to the x-height of the GitLab wordmark:

<img src="/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/x-height.png" class="full-width">

![Logo safe space](/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/logo-safe-space.png/index.html.md){: .medium.center}

![Logo safe space](/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/icon-safe-space.png/index.html.md){: .small.center}

The x-height also determines the proper spacing between icon and workdmark, as well as, the correct scale of the icon relative to the wordmark:

![Logo safe space](/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/stacked-logo-safe-space.png/index.html.md){: .small.center}

### The Tanuki

The [tanuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog/index.html.md) is a very smart animal that works together in a group to achieve a common goal. We feel this symbolism embodies GitLab's [vision](/about/#vision/index.html.md) that everyone can contribute, our [values](/about/#values/index.html.md), and our [open source stewardship](/2016/01/11/being-a-good-open-source-steward/index.html.md/index.html.md).

### GitLab trademark & logo guidelines

GitLab is a registered trademark of GitLab, Inc. You are welcome to use the GitLab trademark and logo, subject to the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/index.html.md/index.html.md). The most current version of the GitLab logo can be found on our [Press page](/press/index.html.md/index.html.md).

Under the Creative Commons license, you may use the GitLab trademark and logo so long as you give attribution to GitLab and provide a link to the license. If you make any changes to the logo, you must state so, along with the attribution, and distribute under the same license.

Your use of the GitLab trademark and logo:

- May not be for commercial purposes;
- May not suggest or imply that you or your use of the GitLab trademark or logo is endorsed by GitLab, or create confusion as to whether or not you or your use of the GitLab trademark or logo is endorsed by GitLab; and
- May not suggest or imply or that you are affiliated with GitLab in any way, or create confusion as to whether or not you are affiliated with GitLab in any way.

Examples of improper use of the GitLab trademark and logo:

- The GitLab name may not be used in any root URL, including subdomains such as `gitlab.company.com` or `gitlab.citool.io`.
- The GitLab trademark and/or logo may not be used as the primary or prominent feature on any non-GitLab materials.

### Using other logos

Logos used on the about.gitlab.com site should always be in full color and be used to the specifications provided by the owner of that logo, which can usually be found on the owners website. The trust marks component found throughout the site is the only exception and should use a neutral tone:

<img src="/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/trust-marks.png" class="full-width">

### Colors

While the brand is ever-evolving, the GitLab brand currently consists of six primary colors that are used in a wide array of marketing materials.

##### Hex/RGB

![GitLab Hex/RGB Colors](/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/gitlab-hex-rgb-colors.png/index.html.md)

### Typography

The GitLab brand uses the Source Sans Pro font family. Headers (h1, h2, etc./index.html.md) always have a weight of 600 (unless used in special situations like large, custom quotes/index.html.md) and the body text always has a weight of 400. Headers should not be given custom classes, they should be used as tags and tags alone (h1, h2, etc./index.html.md) and their sizes or weights should not be changed, unless rare circumstances occur. Here are typography tags.

`H1: Header Level 1`

`H2: Header Level 2`

`H3: Header Level 3`

`H4: Header Level 4`

`p: Body text`

### Buttons

Buttons are an important facet to any design system. Buttons define a call to action that lead people somewhere related to the content it's contained in. There are common practices and data that prove certain types of buttons work better for conversion than others. Here are buttons and their classes that should be used throughout the marketing website:

#### Primary buttons

Primary buttons are solid and should be the default buttons used. Depending on the color scheme of the content, purple or orange solid buttons can be used depending on the background color of the content. These primary buttons should be used on white or lighter gray backgrounds or any background that has a high contrast with the button color. They should also be a `%a` tag so it can be linked elsewhere and for accessibility. Buttons should also be given the class `margin-top20` if the button lacks space between itself and the content above.

<div class="flex-container flex-column flex-start margin-bottom20">
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn orange margin-top20">Primary Button 1</a>
  <pre class="highlight shell">.btn.cta-btn.orange</pre>
  <p>OR</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn purple">Primary Button 2</a>
  <pre class="highlight shell">.btn.cta-btn.purple</pre>
</div>

#### Secondary Buttons

There will be times when two buttons are needed. This will be in places such as [our jobs page](/jobs/index.html.md/index.html.md), where we have a button to view opportunities and one to view our culture video. In this example, both buttons are solid, but one is considered the primary button (orange/index.html.md), and the other is the secondary button (white/index.html.md). The CSS class for the solid white button is <br> `.btn.cta-btn.btn-white`.

<img src="/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/jobs-buttons-example.png" class="full-width">

This is the proper use of two buttons, both being solid, but different colors based on heirarchy. If the background is white or a lighter color that doesn't contrast well with a white-backgound button, a ghost button should be used as a secondary button, and should match in color to the primary button beside it as shown below:

<div class="buttons-container flex-start">
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn orange margin-top20">Primary Button</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn ghost-orange margin-top20">Secondary Button</a>
</div>

<div class="buttons-container flex-start margin-bottom20">
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn purple margin-top20">Primary Button</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn ghost-purple margin-top20">Secondary Button</a>
</div>

DO NOT: Do not use these ghost buttons styles as standalone buttons. They have been proven to be less effective than solid buttons [in a number of studies](https://conversionxl.com/blog/ghost-buttons/index.html.md/index.html.md). They should only be used as a secondary button, next to a solid primary button that already exists. Here are the classes for the secondary buttons:

<div class="flex-container flex-column flex-start margin-bottom20">
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn ghost-orange margin-top20">Secondary Button 1</a>
  <pre class="highlight shell">.btn.cta-btn.ghost-orange</pre>
  <a href="https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#primary-buttons" class="btn cta-btn ghost-purple">Secondary Button 2</a>
  <pre class="highlight shell">.btn.cta-btn.ghost-purple</pre>
</div>

### Iconography

Icons are a valuable visual component to the GitLab brand; contributing to the overall visual language and user experience of a webpage, advertisement, or slide deck. The GitLab iconography currently consists of "label icons" and "content icons", each are explained in further detail below:

#### Label icons

Label icons are intended to support usability and interaction. These are found in interactive elements of the website such as navigation and [toggles](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/index.html.md/index.html.md).

![Label icons example](/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/label-icons-example.png/index.html.md){: .medium.center}

#### Content icons

Content icons are intended to provide visual context and support to content on a webpage; these icons also have a direct correlation to our illustration style with the use of bold outlines and fill colors.

A few examples include our [event landing pages](https://about.gitlab.com/events/aws-reinvent/index.html.md/index.html.md) and [Resources page](https://about.gitlab.com/resources/index.html.md/index.html.md).

<img src="/imageshttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/design/content-icons-example.png" class="full-width">

### Brand oversight

Occasionally the [old GitLab logo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-artwork/blob/master/archive/logo/fox.png/index.html.md) is still in use on partner websites, diagrams or images, and within our own documentation. If you come across our old logo in use, please bring it to our attention by creating an issue in the [Marketing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/issues/index.html.md) issue tracker. Please include a link and screenshot (if possible/index.html.md) in the description of the issue and we will follow-up to get it updated. Thanks for contributing to our brand integrity!

### [GitLab Product UX Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ux_guide/index.html.md/index.html.md)

The goal of this guide is to provide written standards, principles and in-depth information to design beautiful and effective GitLab features. This is a living document and will be updated and expanded as we iterate.

### [GitLab Product UX Design Pattern Library](https://brand.ai/git-lab/primary-brand/index.html.md/index.html.md)

We've broken out the GitLab interface into a set ofÂ atomic pieces to form this design pattern library. This library allows us to see all of our patterns in one place and to build consistently across our entire product.

## General editorial style guidelines

We use American English by default and follow the AP Style guide unless otherwise
noted in this style guide. We do not use title case.

- [Abbreviations](#abbreviations/index.html.md)
- [Acronyms](#acronyms/index.html.md)
- [Ampersands](#ampersands/index.html.md)
- [Capitalization](#capitalization/index.html.md)
- [Contractions](#contractions/index.html.md)

## Abbreviations

## Acronyms

When using [acryonyms or initialisms](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/acronym-vs-initialism/index.html.md/index.html.md),
ensure that your first mention uses the full term and includes the shortened
version in parentheses directly afterwards. From then on you
may use the acronym or initialism instead.

> Example: A Contributor License Agreement (CLA/index.html.md) is the industry standard for open
source contributions to other projects.

Below are some common acroynms and initialisms we use which don't need to be
defined first (but use sparingly, see [Tone of voice](#tone-of-voice/index.html.md) above/index.html.md):

- AFAIK - as far as I know
- ICYMI - in case you missed it (for social only/index.html.md)
- IIRC - if I recall correctly
- IRL - in real life
- TL;DR - too long; didn't read

## Ampersands

Use ampersands only where they are part of a company's name or the title of a
publication or similar. Example: Barnes & Noble

Do not use as a substitute for "and."

## Capitalization
Use [sentence case](https://www.thoughtco.com/sentence-case-titles-1691944/index.html.md) for
all titles and headings.

All GitLab feature names must be capitalized. Examples: GitLab Issue Boards,
GitLab Pages.

See [below](#word-list/index.html.md) for styling of specific words.

## Contractions

We favor contractions ("can't," "didn't," "it's," "we're"/index.html.md) to sound more human and
less formal.

## Formatting
## Lists
## Numbers

Spell out one to nine. Use numerals for 10 upwards. Try to avoid beginning a
sentence with a number, but if unavoidable, spell it out.

Numbers with four or more digits should include a comma. Examples: 2,000; 100,000

## Punctuation

Only one space after a period is necessary.

Include one space after ellipses (... /index.html.md)

See [below](#word-list/index.html.md) for when to hyphenate specific words.

We use en dashes (â€/index.html.md) rather than em dashes (â€/index.html.md). Include a space before and after the dash.

## Quotes

Use double quotation marks for direct quotes, and single quotation marks for a quote
within a quote. Single quotation marks may also be used for specialist terms or sayings.

Include punctuation in quotation marks.

> Example: What do you think of the claim, "software is eating the world?"

## Word choice

When in doubt, use the "future" styling of a word. So, "internet" is not capitalized,
"startup" is not hyphenated, etc.

## Word list

How to spell and style commonly used words.

- Agile
   - A is capitalized when referring to [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development/index.html.md)
- cloud native
    - not capitalized, and no hyphen, regardless of how it is used
- continuous delivery, deployment, integration
    - not capitalized
- developer
    - may only be shortened to "dev" on social
- DevOps
    - D and O always capitalized
- Git
    - always capitalized
- GitHub
- GitLab
    - G and L are always capitalized, even in GitLab.com
- internet

## Swag

* We aim to have our swag delight and/ or be useful.
* We aim to have swag that is versatile and easy to store and transport. As a remote company with employees in over 40 countries, our swag often has to go on miraculous journeys. With this in mind we try to ship things that are durable, light, and that will be unlikely to gt stuck in customs.
* We aim to make limited edition and themed swag for the community to collect. Bigger events will have custom tanuki stickers in small runs, only available at their specific event.
* We aim to do swag in a way that doesn't take a lot of time to execute => self serve => [web shop](https://gitlab.myshopify.com/index.html.md/index.html.md)
* We get a lot of requests to send swag, and we try to respond to them all. If you would like to get some GitLab swag for your team or event, please see below for more info on submitting a swag. Note: We recommend you request swag at least 4 weeks out from the event date or we may not be able to accommodate your request.

### Community Swag Requests:
Email your request to sponsorships@gitlab.com. In your request please include the expected number of guests, the best shipping address, and phone number along with what kind of swag you are hoping for. The swag we have available can be found on our online store. Note: We recommend you request swag at least 4 weeks out from the event date or we may not be able to accommodate your request.

### Internal GitLab swag ordering:
* Event Swag: To request additional GitLab materials for an event you are attending see instructions below.
  * The event in questions must be 4 or more weeks away for all swag and material requests, as rush shipping is not an option using the link below.
  * You can place small event swag orders with [this link](https://get.printfection.com/ybddf/6351118868/index.html.md). This link can only be accessed via your gitlab.com email address. The request will be approved on the back end by the Field Marketing team. If you do not see what you are looking for in this portal contact events@gitlab.com.
  * Paper/ Print Collateral: In order to be [efficient](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/values/#efficiency/index.html.md), we do not make custom print assets for events. The [GitLab one-page datasheet](/images/press/gitlab-data-sheet.pdf/index.html.md) and the [GitLab Capabilities Statement](/images/press/gitlab-capabilities-statement.pdf/index.html.md) are the only print assets that we should use for events.  
  * For sales reps, we have put together a [swag kit](https://get.printfection.com/dcdzm/6508378270/index.html.md) you may order.
  * For printed materials (one pager, cheat sheets/index.html.md) please email events@gitlab.com.
  * For larger swag orders (stickers in a quantity of 100 or greater/index.html.md), do not go through the swag store but rather use our [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/index.html.md/index.html.md) account or ping emily@gitlab.com. You will need the same information (address and order quantity/index.html.md).
* GitLabbers- if you would like to order something from the GitLab swag shop we have a discount code you can use for 30% off. Please see the swag slack channel to get code to be used in the [store](https://shop.gitlab.com/index.html.md/index.html.md) at checkout. It can be found in the channel description.

### Swag for customer/ prospects
Anyone with access to Salesforce can send swag through Salesforce directly. Please review [sending swag to customers paramaters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales/issues/144/index.html.md). Instructions on how to do so below:
1. Create general task for whichever contact you want to send swag to. You need to create a task and save it before the "order swag" button will show up as an option in the task menu.
1. Go into created and saved task and click the button that says "order swag".
1. If you do not see the window pop up for ordering, please check your pop up settings and verify pop ups are not being blocked.   
1. Previous step will bring up a printfrection page where you can order desired swag. (please note not all swag is listed in sfdc, for more options email emily@gitlab.com/index.html.md).

* We have GitLab stationary/ note cards- leave note in swag slack channel of you would like a batch to send notes to prospects/ customers/ community members.

* _NOTE:_ Please keep in mind the [list of countries we do not do business in](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/sales-process/images_sales_process/#export-control/index.html.md).

### Swag Providers We Use
* See [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/issues/1554/index.html.md) for vendors we use and what we order from them.
* Please direct swag vendor suggestions to the Swag slack channel.

### New and Replenishment Swag Orders
Corporate handles the creating and ordering of all new swag. All swag designs should be run past design for approval before going to production.
* If you need swag for an upcoming event complete the swag selection of the event template and corporate will be in touch on issue to complete request. Note: at least 4 weeks to produce anything new and 2 weeks to reorder current designs.  
* If you see something running low in Printfection feel free to ping us in swag slack channel, but note we often do small runs of things or have items we are trying to phase out.  
* Reordering of inventory for internal swag requests is done by corporate team. See section above on swag providers we use for items that Printfection cannot produce.

### How to add events to the [about.gitlab.com/events](/events/index.html.md/index.html.md) page

### How to add an event specific landing page linking from the [about.gitlab.com/events page](/events/index.html.md/index.html.md)

At times, we will want to create an event specific page that links from the [about.gitlab.com/events](/events/index.html.md/index.html.md) page. The purpose of this page is to let people know additional details about GitLabâ€™s presence at the event, how to get in touch with us at the event, and conference sessions we are speaking in (if applicable/index.html.md).   

Ops Steps needed before page can lunch:

1. Create an issue in the general marketing project using the Event Landing Page Ops template. Ops needs the following info:
   1. Who will be at the live event taking meetings. This person will also need to be setup in Outreach.
   2. Meeting time and dates open for meeting scheduling, plus default meeting duration
   3. Copy for invite flow- this is what customer will see once they set meeting.

Steps to take to create the new page:

1. Create new a new branch of the [www-gitlab-com project.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/index.html.md). - Branch name should be what event youâ€™ve added.
2. From new Branch, navigate to `Data`, then to `events.yml`
3. Scroll down to the area where its date appropriate to add the event
4. Add event using instructions in [handbook](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#how-to-add-an-event-to-the-eventsyml/index.html.md)
5. To create the event specific page you need to add a subset of the following information:

	- **url:** - you make this up based on what you want the URL to be from about.gitlab.com
	- **header_background:** choose from an image already in the images folder or add your own image. If you do not know how to do this, please watch [this tutorial](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14wCjHZLbcUUDArGYBNeinsHAlET6ubMy/index.html.md).  
	- **header_image:** choose from an image already in the images folder or add your own. (optional- if you prefer not to include, remove field altogether/index.html.md)
	- **header_description:** what CTA would you like the person to do on the page
	- **booth:** booth number at event, if there is no booth number, then remove this line of code (optional/index.html.md)
	- **form:** code that tells the system to add the contact info form. Marketing Ops will provide you with this number. They need to create a specific form for each page associated with a campaign in sfc.
	- **title:** CTA for why someone would want to give their contact info. Also used in `contact:` to distinguish a header title.
	- **description:** additional info on why someone would want to give their contact info
	- **number:** Marketo form number - Marketing Operations will need to give this number to you. Under `form:`
	- **content:** all of the information in the example section is all optional based on your event. If its not needed, simply delete.
6. Please watch [this tutorial](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14wCjHZLbcUUDArGYBNeinsHAlET6ubMy/index.html.md) for additional help.

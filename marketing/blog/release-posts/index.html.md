## Release posts

GitLab releases a new version every 22nd of each month, and announces it through monthly release posts.

Patch and security issues are addressed more often, whenever necessary.

- For a list of release posts (both security and regular/index.html.md), check the
  category [releases](/blog/categories/releases/index.html.md/index.html.md).
- For a list of features per release, check the [releases](/releases/index.html.md/index.html.md).
- For all named changes, check the changelog
  for [GitLab CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/index.html.md)
  and [GitLab EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md/index.html.md).
- See also [release managers](/release-managers/index.html.md/index.html.md).

### Templates

To start a new release post, please choose one of
these templates, and follow their instructions
to insert content. Please make sure to use
the most recent template available.

- [Monthly release](#getting-started/index.html.md)

## Monthly releases

Monthly releases have an exclusive layout aiming to appraise the reader with the presentation of a new release every 22nd.

**Note:** The new design for monthly release posts was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/4780/index.html.md) in March 2017 with the release of [GitLab 9.0](/2017/03/22/gitlab-9-0-released/index.html.md/index.html.md). The new layout was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/5937/index.html.md) in May 2017 with the release of [GitLab 9.2](/2017/03/22/gitlab-9-2-released/index.html.md/index.html.md).

### Getting started

To create a new monthly release post, add two files to the [about.GitLab.com repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/index.html.md/index.html.md) (consider the release of GitLab X.Y, released in YYYY/MM/DD/index.html.md):

- A YAML data file, containing all the release post content
  - Into `data/release_posts/`, add a new file called `YYYY_MM_22_gitlab_X_Y_released.yml`
  - Template ([latest version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/templates/blog/YYYY_MM_DD_gitlab_x_y_released.yml/index.html.md)/index.html.md)
- A blog post file, containing the introduction and the blog post frontmatter information
  - Into `source/posts/`, add a new file called `YYYY-MM-22-gitlab-X-Y-released.html.md`
  - Template ([latest version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/templates/blog/monthly_release_blog_template.html.md/index.html.md)/index.html.md)

**Important!** Please use the most recent templates for each of these files.
{:.alert .alert-info .text-center}

#### Merge request

Create a merge request with the introductory changes _before the kick off call_ to make the post available to receive contributions from the team.

Set the title to "WIP: Release post - GitLab X.Y".

Check "Remove source branch when merge request is accepted".
Consider to check "Squash commits when merge request is accepted" only if there are too many commits that are useless (typos, styling, etc.../index.html.md).

The branch name must be `release-X-Y`.

Please use the release post template for your MR:

![release post MR template](release-post-mr-template.png/index.html.md){:.shadow}

**Important**: all the files related to the release process, including `data/features.yml`, `data/mvps.yml` and `source/includes/hello-bar.html.haml` must be committed in this MR.
{:.alert .alert-info}

#### Authorship

Each month a Product Manager or a Technical Writer will lead the release post, as defined in the [Release Post Scheduling page](managers/index.html.md/index.html.md).

The author is accountable for:
- Creating the [merge request](#merge-request/index.html.md)
- Writing the [performance improvements](#performance-improvements/index.html.md) section
- Choosing the [MVP](#mvp/index.html.md), writing the post section, and updating `data/mvps.yml`
- Adding the [cover image](#cover-image/index.html.md) and the [social sharing image](#social-sharing-image/index.html.md)
- Updating the home page banner (`source/includes/hello-bar.html.haml`/index.html.md)
- Making sure all the features listed in the [direction](/direction/index.html.md/index.html.md)
page are included in the post
- @mentioning the [release manager](/release-managers/index.html.md/index.html.md) to remind them
to add the [upgrade barometer](#upgrade-barometer/index.html.md) section
- Helping to solve all comments in the thread (bugging people on chat/index.html.md)
- Making sure all images (png, jpg, and gifs/index.html.md) are smaller than 300 KB each
- Ping the PMs on Slack asking for anything missing, wrong, or pending feedback
- On the 16th (or the following workday/index.html.md), run the release post through an
automated spell and grammar check
- Assigning the MR to the reviewers (tech writing team, marketing, VP Product/index.html.md)
when it's ready for their reviews
- Pull `master` into the release post on the 21st to make sure there are
no merge conflicts (do not rebase, please do `git pull origin master`, then `:wq`/index.html.md)
- Making sure we have the post **ready to merge two working days before the 22nd**
- Merging the post on the 22nd (coordinate with the release manager in the
`#releases` chat channel to only merge the post once deploy has completed
and the packages published/index.html.md)
- Posting on Social Media (Twitter/Facebook/index.html.md) or, in case you don't have access,
coordinating with someone who has (e.g. Marcia, Erica, Rebecca, Emily vH/index.html.md)
- Adding any updates on the the release post process to the handbook

#### Messaging lead

Each month a Product Marketing Manager (PMM/index.html.md) will lead the messaging and positioning for
the release post.

The messaging lead is responsible for:

- Deciding on the [top three features](#top-three-features/index.html.md)
- Writing the blog post [introduction](#introduction/index.html.md)
- Making sure all feature descriptions have [strong messaging](#messaging-review/index.html.md)

##### Top three features

- PMM decides on the top 3
- Get input from the PM team  
- Join the monthly kick-off call (usually on the 8th, two months ahead of the release/index.html.md) and look at the direction page to get an opinion on what you think should be the top 3.
- If you canâ€™t make the kick-off call, review the [kick-off call agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElPkZ90A8ey_iOkTvUs_ByMlwKK6NAB2VOK5835wYK0/edit/index.html.md) Â 
- You can also look at the [direction page](/direction/index.html.md/index.html.md) farther ahead of time to see whatâ€™s scheduled for that release.
- The top 2-3 features get mentioned in the post title, and they are what you will write about in the [intro](#introduction/index.html.md).

##### Messaging review

- The messaging lead should review the messaging for all of the features in the post and `features.yml`.
- The release features are listed in a YAML data file linked as "Items" in the release post MR description. For example, see the [data file for GitLab 11.1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/release-11-1/data/release_posts/2018_07_22_gitlab_11_1_released.yml/index.html.md)
- The order of features in this file is the order they appear in the blog post.  
- More impactful features should be closer to the top of the blog post.  
- Review the messaging for these features (e.g. are they only functional descriptions or do they describe the problem and how the feature solves it?/index.html.md)  
    - Look at the issue and MR for the feature, they are linked in the YAML. Sometimes the issue description will include the value prop. Read the comments in the issue and MR for the feature, often users and customers will chime in with why they want a feature and what pain the lack of the feature is causing.
- Leave comments for the PMs in the items file. Make sure to comment in the diff on the line that you are referring to so that the PM has the context and comments can be resolved appropriately.
    - @mention the PM who owns the feature to ask, â€œwhatâ€™s the pain point, what are the use cases for this feature?â€
    - See [writing about features](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/#writing-about-features/index.html.md) as a guideline for what feature descriptions show have.
- The release post and `features.yml` can have the same or very similar content. E.g. same screen shot.
  - The tone of the release post is more about introducing the feature "we're happy to ship XYZ..."
  - The tone of `features.yml` should be [evergreen](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-evergreen-content-definition-dos-and-don-ts-2316028/index.html.md) to appear on our website in various places.

#### Stages of contribution

Monthly release posts are created in two stages:

- **General contributions**: everyone can contribute!
In this stage, Product Managers will add features and their
respective images, videos, etc. Team members are also welcome
to contribute.
- **Review**:
  - **Content**: the blog post author and messaging lead will review the content
  and copyedit anything necessary
  - **Structure**: tech writing/frontend/ux check the syntax
  and the structure of the blog post.

To be able to finish our work in time, with no rush, each stage will have its due date.

### Due dates

To having the release post well written and ready in time for the release date, please set due dates for:

- [General contributions](#general-contributions/index.html.md) from the Product Managers and
the team: 6th working day before the 22nd
- [Review](#review/index.html.md): 2nd working day before the 22nd

The review should be completed until the 2nd working day before the 22nd, so that
the 1st working day before the release should be left for fixes and small improvements.

### General contributions

Added by the team until the 6th working day before the 22nd. Please fill all the [sections](#sections/index.html.md).

They are mostly added by the Product Managers, each filling up the sections they are [accountable for](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/#who-to-talk-to-for-what/index.html.md).

#### Accountability

**You are responsible for the content you add to the blog post**. Therefore,
make sure that:

- all new features in this release are in the release post.
- all the entries are correct and not missing (especially links to the documentation or feature webpages when available/index.html.md).
- feature tier availability: all contain the [correct entry](#feature-availability/index.html.md).
- all primary features are accompanied by their images.
- all new features are added to [`data/features.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/features.md/index.html.md) _with a screenshot accompanying the feature_.
  - all images are optimized (compressed with [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/index.html.md) set to lossy 80%,
[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/index.html.md/index.html.md), or other tool of your preference/index.html.md) **and** smaller than 300KB.
  - if you are adding a gif, it should be compressed as much as possible and smaller than 300KB. If it's bigger than that, use a video instead.

Write the description of every feature as you do to regular blog posts. Please write according to
the [markdown guide](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/index.html.md/index.html.md).

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red"></i>
**Important!** Make sure to merge `master` into the release post branch **before
pushing changes** to any existing file to avoid merge conflicts. Do not rebase,
do `git pull origin master` then `:wq`.
{: .alert .alert-info}

#### PMs checklist

Once the PMs have included everything they're accountable for, they should **check their item** in the release post MR description: `<MR link>#features`:

```hmtl
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/6239#features
```

![PMs check list](features-checklist.png/index.html.md){:.shadow}

By checking your item, you will make it clear to the author that you have done your part in time (during the general contributions stage/index.html.md) and you're waiting for review. If you don't check it, it's implicit that you didn't finish your part in time, despite that's the case or not.

#### Notes for PMs

**Vacations:**

If you are on vacations before/during the release fill all your items, and create placeholders in the release post Yaml file for all the items you cannot add for whatever reason. To complete them, and to follow up with all the content you are responsible for, assign someone to take over for you and notify the author.

**Replies:**

Please respond to comments in the MR thread as soon as possible. We have a non-negotiable due date for release posts.

**Documentation:**

Please add the `documentation_link` at the same time you add a feature block to the release post. When you leave it to add it later, you will probably forget it, the reviewer will ping you later on during the review stage, and you will have little time to write, get your MR reviewed, approved, merged, and available in docs.gitlab.com.

Always link to the [EE version of GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/index.html.md/index.html.md) in the blog post, even if it is a CE feature.

### Introduction

The messaging lead writes the introduction for the release post.

Add the copy for the intro to the blog post file (`YYYY-MM-DD-gitlab-X-Y-released.html.md`/index.html.md), in regular markdown. This file linked at the top of the release post MR. E.g. [GitLab 11.2 blog post file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/release-11-2/source/posts/2018-08-22-gitlab-11-2-released.html.md/index.html.md)

```md
Introductory paragraph

Introduction
```

The first paragraph is the one that catches the eyes of the reader, it should be punchy giving a summary of the most significant features. This first paragraph can then be used as a summary on the homepage and on social media. It should catch attention and cause the reader to want to read more.

The following paragraphs should highlight the business value of top 3 features and link to the feature description (link using the feature headings' anchors/index.html.md). It's important to highlight the pain points solved and the value the feature provides.

A final paragraph can give a shout out to additional features encouraging the reader to read the full release notes to learn about all the features have that shipped.

@mention the PMs whose features are included the intro and ask them to review.

Examples of previous release post intros written by PMM:

 - [GitLab 10.8 released](/2018/05/22/gitlab-10-8-released/index.html.md/index.html.md)
 - [GitLab 11.0 released](/2018/06/22/gitlab-11-0-released/index.html.md/index.html.md)
 - [GitLab 11.1 released](/2018/07/22/gitlab-11-1-released/index.html.md/index.html.md)

### CTA

Call-to-action buttons displayed at the end of the introduction. A CTA to the [events page](/events/index.html.md/index.html.md) is added by default. Add webcasts, or custom buttons to this entry whenever necessary.

```yaml
cta:
  - title: Join us for an upcoming event
    link: '/events/'
  - title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
  - link:
```

### MVP

To display the MVP of the month, use the example provided in this template, and adjust it to your case. Don't forget to link to the MR with the MVP's contribution.

```yaml
mvp:
  fullname: Dosuken Shinya # full name
  gitlab: dosuken123 # gitlab.com username
  description: | # supports markdown. Please link to the MR with the MVP's contribution.
    Dosuken extended our [Pipelines API](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/pipelines.html#list-project-pipelines/index.html.md)
    by [adding additional search attributes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/9367/index.html.md).
    This is a huge improvement to our CI API, for example enabling queries to easily return the latest
    pipeline for a specific branch, as well as a host of other possibilities. Dosuken also made a great
    contribution last release, laying the foundation for
    [scheduled pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/10133/index.html.md). Thanks Dosuken!
```

Suggestions should be ideally added along the month into the `#release-post` channel, as soon as you see a contribution, or a set of contributions that you think are great and should be taken into consideration for the choice. Every GitLab team member is encouraged to add suggestions to the channel, always linking to issues and merge requests.

Additionally, close to the release date, the release post author will request suggestions from colleagues and the core team in the `#development` chat channel, as well as from the team leads in the `#release-post` channel.

Based on both discussions, the release post author will make a decision. They should not wait for consensus. There can only be one MVP.

The MVP will be prized with a gift from GitLab, usually a swag pack. :/index.html.md)

**Important**: remember to update `data/mvps.yml` with the new MVP.
{:.alert .alert-info}

### Features

The most relevant features of the release are included in the post by [product managers](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/#who-to-talk-to-for-what/index.html.md). Classify the feature according to its relevance and to where you want to place it in the blog post:

#### Top feature

The most important feature of the release, mentioned right after the MVP section. Images can be added at will in the description entry. A link to the documentation is required.

#### Primary features

Features with higher impact, displayed in rows after the top feature, with an image next to its text. An image accompanying the description is required. A [video](#videos/index.html.md) can also be added to replace the image.

#### Secondary features (other improvements/index.html.md)

Relevant improvements in GitLab. Image is not required, but recommended.

### Feature blocks

Use feature blocks to add features to the YAML data file. The layout will be applied automatically by Middleman's [templating system](/2016/06/10/ssg-overview-gitlab-pages-part-2/#template_engine/index.html.md).

Feature blocks in the YAML data file contain the following entries, as exemplified below:

```yaml
- name: Multi-Project Pipeline Graphs
  available_in: [premium, ultimate]
  documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html#multi-project-pipelines-graphs'
  image_url: '/images/9_3/multi-project_pipelines.png'
  reporter: bikebilly
  team: Secure
  issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2121'
  description: |
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipisicing](#link/index.html.md) elit.
```

#### Feature name

- `name`: feature name, capitalized

Use a short and strong name for all feature names.

#### Feature Availability

Use the following pattern to apply the correct badge to the feature (Core, Starter, Premium, Ultimate/index.html.md).

- `available_in`: availability of that feature in GitLab:
  - For GitLab Core, use `[core, starter, premium, ultimate]`
  - For GitLab Starter, use `[starter, premium, ultimate]`
  - For GitLab Premium, use `[premium, ultimate]`
  - For GitLab Ultimate, use `[ultimate]`

If the feature is available in GitLab.com, the badges for GitLab.com will be
applied automatically according to the self-managed availability. For example,
`available_in: [premium, ultimate]` will "turn on" the badges Premium, Ultimate,
Silver, and Gold.

If the feature is not available in GitLab.com, e.g., LDAP and admin settings,
use the tag `gitlab_com: false` to turn off the entire GitLab.com badges' row. For
example, for GitLab Geo features, use:

```yaml
available_in: [premium, ultimate]
gitlab_com: false
```

#### Documentation

Provide a link to the updated documentation for the feature. It is a required field.
It can be, in this priority order:

- A **feature documentation** link, when available
- A **feature-related documentation** link, when a dedicated doc is not available.

**Important**: always link to the EE documentation, even if the feature is available in CE.
{:.alert .alert-info}

Note: `documentation_text` was deprecated by [!13283](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/13283/index.html.md) for GitLab 11.2.

#### Illustration (images, videos/index.html.md)

- `image_url`: link to the image which illustrates that feature.
Required for primary features, optional for secondary features and top feature.
- `image_noshadow: true`: if an image (`image_url`/index.html.md) already has shadow
the entry `image_noshadow` will remove the shadow applied with CSS by default. Optional.
- `video`: when present, overrides the image and displays the linked video instead. Use the [link for embed videos](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#videos/index.html.md). Available for primary features only. For all other blocks, add it into the description entries.

Check the section **Adding Content** > [Illustrations](#illustrations/index.html.md) for more information.

#### Feature reporter

- `reporter`: GitLab handle of the user adding the feature block to
the release post (not the feature author/index.html.md).
This should be the PM responsible for the feature, so in the review
phase anyone knows who they have to ping in order to get clarifications.
It is a required field.

#### Team

- `team`: GitLab team that implemented the feature described in the item.
This should be one of the values allowed for [Team labels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#team-labels/index.html.md).
With this field set, PMs can easily find anything that is related to their area, even if reported by other users.
It is a required field.

#### Related issue, epic, merge request, or webpage

- `issue_url`: link to the issue on GitLab.com where the feature is discussed
and developed. Using this link the reviewer can check the status of the specific
feature for consistency and additional references.
It is a required field, but can be replaced with `mr_url`, `issueboard_url`, or `epic_url`.
Always wrap links in single quotes (`'https://example.com'`/index.html.md).
- `issueboard_url`: link to the issue board related to the feature. Not required, but available.
- `mr_url`: link to the MR that introduced the feature. Not required, but available.
- `epic_url`: link to the epic related to the feature. Not required, but available.
- `webpage_url`: link to the marketing webpage for a given feature. Not required, but available.

#### Feature description

- `description: |`: add the feature's description in this entry.
Make sure your cursor is in the line below the pipeline symbol `|` intended once.
All `description` fields fully support [markdown](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/index.html.md/index.html.md), the only thing you need to be worried about is respecting the indentation.

### Cover image license

According to our [Blog handbook](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/blog/#cover-image/index.html.md), it's necessary to provide the source of the cover image. Fill in the entry below to display this info at the very end of the blog post:

```yaml
cover_img:
  image_url: '#link_to_original_image'
  licence: CC0 # which licence the image is available with
  licence_url: '#link_to_licence'
```

### Upgrade barometer

Describes the information about upgrading GitLab to the new version. To be added by the [release manager](/release-managers/index.html.md/index.html.md) during the [general contributions](#general-contributions/index.html.md) stage, who can ask for backend team leads' review. Should include the following info before the review starts (6th working day before the 22nd/index.html.md):

- How should the upgrade be done? Please detail.
- Do we expect downtime? If so, how long will it take? Please detail.
- Please detail migrations, post migrations, background migrations.
- Are there any special cases, something important to note? Please detail.

You can use the template presented in the [release post data file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/templates/blog/YYYY_MM_DD_gitlab_x_y_released.yml#L176/index.html.md).

Note: It's important to have this section added with all the others, but, of course, it can be updated later if necessary.

### Performance improvements

To be added by the engineering leads, in the "general contributions" stage.

Describes relevant performance improvements individually, when present. Otherwise, you can either use this standard redaction or write a new one:

```yaml
- name: Performance Improvements
  available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
  performance_url: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&label_name%5B%5D=performance&milestone_title=X.X # merged MRs in the corresponding milestone
  reporter: bikebilly
  description: |
    We are continuing to make great strides improving
    the performance of GitLab in every release.
    [We're committed](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/#performance/index.html.md) to not only
    making individual instances of GitLab even faster,
    but also to greatly improving the performance of GitLab.com,
    an instance that has over 1 million users!

    In GitLab X.Y we are shipping performance
    improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and a lot more!
```

Don't forget to replace `X.Y` above with the current release!
{: .alert .alert-info}

### Omnibus improvements

To be added by the [build Product Manager](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/#performance/index.html.md) during the [general contributions](#general-contributions/index.html.md) stage.

### Extras

If you need an extra block to convey important info, and it doesn't fit the other blog post sections, you can use the `extras` block, right before `deprecations` (in the release post YAML datafile/index.html.md):

```yaml
extras:
  - title: "Hello World"
    description: | # supports markdown
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur, beatae!
```

For more multiple blocks, use:


```yaml
extras:
  - title: "Hello World"
    description: | # supports markdown
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur, beatae!
  - title: "Lorem"
    description: | # supports markdown

### Deprecations

Describe the deprecations happening on that release or in upcoming releases. Let our community know about a future deprecation as soon as possible.

The due date is defined by the the removal of that feature. The field is required, and should be set as:

- The date of the removal, e.g., "May 22nd, 2017", or
- An upcoming release (_only_ if the release date in unknown/index.html.md), e.g., "GitLab 12.0", or
- An estimation of the removal date, e.g., "January 22nd, 2019 (estimated/index.html.md)", or
- An estimation of the removal release (_only_ if the release date in unknown/index.html.md), e.g., "GitLab 12.0 (estimated/index.html.md)"

```yaml
deprecations:
  - feature_name: Lorem ipsum dolor
    due: May 22nd, 2017 # example
    reporter: bikebilly # item author username
    description: |  # example (supports markdown/index.html.md)
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
      Veritatis, quisquam.
```

For multiple deprecations, use multiple feature deprecation blocks:

```yaml
deprecations:
  - feature_name: Lorem ipsum dolor
    due: May 22nd, 2017 # example
    description: |  # example (supports markdown/index.html.md)
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
      Veritatis, quisquam.
  - feature_name: Lorem ipsum dolor
    due: May 22nd, 2017. # example
    description: |  # example (supports markdown/index.html.md)
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
      Veritatis, quisquam.
```

### Review

The review is performed after content has been added, so it's important to respect
the due dates, otherwise reviews will have to be done repeatedly.

The review should be completed until the 2nd working day before the 22nd, so that
the 1st working day before the release should be left for fixes and small improvements.

The due dates for each review can be found on the MR description.

#### Content review

The content review is performed by product manager leading the post (author/index.html.md),
who will check if everything is in place, and if there's nothing missing. Will
also make suggestions, ask questions, and make sure all the comments are solved
(ping people on Slack if necessary/index.html.md). Also, assure all items in the "general
contributions" list presented in the MR description have been checked.

The content team will follow with copyedit and check for grammar,
spelling, and typos. Please follow the checklist in the MR description to
guide you through the review.

Lastly, the post should be reviewed by a Marketing team member (PMM, CMM/index.html.md)
to evaluate wording and messaging.

Follow the checklist on the MR description for every review item.

#### Structural check

Once the post is filled with content, the technical writing team,
or, in their abserce, the UX or the frontend team, will check the
syntax and the content structure. Please follow the checklist in
the MR description to guide you through the review.

Give special attention to:

- Filenames
- Frontmatter
  - Authorship
  - Cover image
  - Social sharing image
  - Title
  - Description
  - Category
  - Layout
- Deadlinks
- Social Sharing card (when published/index.html.md): validate with [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator/index.html.md) and [Facebook Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/index.html.md/index.html.md)

##### Frontmatter

Look for each entry in the frontmatter. Wrap text with double quotes and paths with single quotes to prevent the page to break due to special chars.

```yaml
---
release_number: "X.X"
title: "GitLab X.X Released with Feature A and Feature B"
author: Name Surname
author_gitlab: gitlab.com-username
author_twitter: twitter-username
categories: releases
image_title: '/images/X_X/X_X-cover-image.ext'
description: "GitLab 9.0 Released with XXX, YYY, ZZZ, KKK, and much more!"
twitter_image: '/images/tweets/gitlab-X-X-released.jpg'
layout: releases
# header_layout_dark: true #uncomment if the cover image is dark
# release_number_dark: true #uncomment if you want a dark release number
---
```

**Layout:**

The last two entries of the post's frontmatter give the option for a
different layout. If you want to use a dark cover image, you'll need
to uncomment `header_layout_dark: true`.

If you want only the release number to be dark, uncomment
`release_number_dark: true`.

These two variables work independently; you can assign either of them
or both of them to the same post.

### Marketing review

A Product Marketing Manager should conduct the marketing review
for checking the approach, the messaging, and anything else they
find relevant. Please follow the checklist in the MR description.

## Adding content

For entries that support markdown, use regular [markdown Kramdown](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/index.html.md/index.html.md), as we use for all blog posts and webpages on about.GitLab.com.

### Illustrations

#### Images

- {:#alt} Make sure every image has an
[alternative text](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#image-alt-text/index.html.md)
- {:#images-compressed} Each image should be compressed with [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/index.html.md),
[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/index.html.md/index.html.md), or similar tool
- {:#image-size-limit} Each image should not surpass 300KB, gifs included
- {:#application-screenshots} **Application screenshots**:
  - Make sure that the application screenshot captures the feature to make it immediately recognizable
  - Include as much UI context as possible to allow the reader to identify where this feature is available, ideally the full application interface
  - Screenshots throughout the post should be harmonic and consistent in terms of their size and quality
  
- {:#gifs} **Animated gifs**:
  - If a gif isn't necessary, replace it with a static image (.png, .jpg/index.html.md)
  - If an animation is necessary but the gif > 300KB, use a video instead
- {:#cover-image} **Cover image**:
use a unique cover image for every post, usually from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/index.html.md/index.html.md), and add
[the required copyright info](#cover-image-license/index.html.md) into the Yaml file.
This image should be eyes-catching and inspiring. Suggested aspect ratio is 3:1 and resolution should be enough to be good-looking on big displays.
- {:#image-shadow} **Image shadow**:
when you add images though the text,
make sure all images have the class shadow applied:
  - `![image alt text](#img-url/index.html.md){:.shadow}`
  - If the original image already has shadow applied, don't use `{:.shadow}`.
  - If you're inserting the image in the YAML file via `image_url` entry, add the `image_noshadow: true` [entry](#feature-blocks/index.html.md) right after `image_url`.
- {:#social-sharing-image} **Social sharing image**:
It's recommended to add a [social sharing image](../index.html#social-media-info/index.html.md)
to the blog post. It is the image that will display on
social media feeds whenever the link to the post is shared.
It's a screenshot from the blog landing page zoomed in. Read the linked blog handbook
for reference, and you can also watch a quick
[video tutorial on how to do it](https://youtu.be/boGIpF-2gw8/index.html.md).
The image should be placed under `source/images/tweets/`
and named after the post's filename (`gitlab-X-X-released.png`/index.html.md).

#### Videos

Every [video should wrapped into a figure tag](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#videos/index.html.md), as in:

```html
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PoBaY_rqeKA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
```

The `<figure>` element is recommended for semantic SEO and the `video_container` class will assure the video is displayed responsively.

Consult the [markdown guide](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#videos/index.html.md) for the correct markdown markup to apply to different sources (YouTube, Google Drive, HTML video/index.html.md).

For feature blocks, you can add a video instead of an image, by using the entry `video:`. If present, the feature section won't display any images, only the video. Example:

```yaml
- name: Awesome Feature
  available_in: [premium, ultimate]
  documentation_link: ''
  video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/eH-GuoqlweM"
  description: |
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quae, provident.
```

## Technical aspects

Understand how a release post is formed:

- **Template:**
  - [Layout (Haml/index.html.md) file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/source/layouts/release.haml/index.html.md):
  creates a layout for the final HTML file, and requires the include file below.
  - [Include (Haml/index.html.md) file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/source/includes/release.html.haml/index.html.md):
  builds the content of the post applying custom styles. Its markup includes semantic SEO improvements.
- **Content:**
  - **YAML data file**: gathers the actual content for the blog post, except the introduction ([template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/templates/blog/YYYY_MM_DD_gitlab_x_y_released.yml/index.html.md), [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/release_posts/2017_05_22_gitlab_9_2_released.yml/index.html.md)/index.html.md).
  - **Blog post file**: the blog post file, which holds the introduction of the blog post and its frontmatter ([template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/templates/blog/monthly_release_blog_template.html.md/index.html.md), [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/source/posts/2017-05-22-gitlab-9-2-released.html.md/index.html.md)/index.html.md).

The template files form the blog post, therefore, don't need to be changed every release. The content files are the ones to be added every release with its unique content, as described by the section [getting started](#getting-started/index.html.md).

To learn more how the templating system works, read through an overview on [Modern Static Site Generators](/2016/06/10/ssg-overview-gitlab-pages-part-2/index.html.md/index.html.md).

### Release post merge request template

The [release post MR template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Release-Post.md/index.html.md) is our checklist for every release. Let's keep it up-to-date! :/index.html.md)

### Release post managers (RPM/index.html.md)

To update the [release post managers](managers/index.html.md/index.html.md), edit the data file below.

- **[Data YAML file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/release_post_managers.yml/index.html.md)**: gathers the release post managers for every release (9.0 onwards/index.html.md).
- **[Layout Haml file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/sourcehttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/index.html.haml/index.html.md)**: simple handbook layout that pulls the data from the YAML file above.

<style>
  pre { margin-bottom: 20px; }
</style>

### Plan

1. Recognize new code contributors after their first merged MR
1. Pairing new code contributors with mentors
1. Regular live-stream calls with the [Core Team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/index.html.md/index.html.md)
1. Blog post series featuring contributors 

### Mentor program
After the first merged MR, make an offer (in an outreach email per the template below/index.html.md) to pair the new contributor with an experienced mentor from the community.  This is for a limited time period only (2 weeks/index.html.md) so that mentors are not overly burdened.  

Currently, the mentors consist of Core Team with plans to expand the mentor group.  

### Working with the Core Team
There will be a monthly call with members of the [Core Team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/index.html.md/index.html.md) using the Zoom conferencing tool and meetings will also be recorded. Since Core Team members are spread out in different time zones, meeting times will be rotated.   

[Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-core-team/general/issues/service_desk/index.html.md) will be used as a communication tool for Core Team members. Anyone can open issues in the Service Desk or send an email to `incoming+gitlab-core-team/general@incoming.gitlab.com`  Core Team members who signed NDAs will also have access to GitLab Slack channels.  

### Contributor blog post series

Goal is to publish a regular blog post featuring contributors from the community.  The format will be a [casual Q&A with a community member](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/08/08/contributor-post-vitaliy/index.html.md/index.html.md) and will be posted on the [GitLab blog page](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/index.html.md/index.html.md). 

When developing a blog post, follow the [blog guidelines](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/blog/#blog-style-guidelines/index.html.md). 

### Outreach Email Templates

#### Outreach after the first merged MR 

```
Hello NAME,

Iâ€™m reaching out to both thank and congratulate you on your first Merge Request (MR/index.html.md) to help improve GitLab.  I wanted to offer you a couple of things as youâ€™re getting started with your code contributions to GitLab.

1. Hereâ€™s a [first-time contributor swag code] so that you can show off your GitLab contribution. 
1. Please let me know if youâ€™d like to be paired with one of the experienced GitLab community members (a mentor/index.html.md) for a few weeks to help with your future contributions to GitLab.  

Thanks again for your first MR to GitLab and welcome to the GitLab community!

Sincerely,
YOUR_NAME
```

#### Outreach to inactive contributors

```
Hello NAME,

Iâ€™m reaching out to you as we have not seen a merged MR from you since DATE.  The GitLab community would not be the same if it werenâ€™t for contributors like you.  If you havenâ€™t done so lately, you can look for issues that are â€œAccepting Merge Requestsâ€ as we would welcome your help on these.  

Please let me know if you have any questions and I look forward to your continued involvement in the GitLab community.  

Sincerely,
YOUR_NAME
```

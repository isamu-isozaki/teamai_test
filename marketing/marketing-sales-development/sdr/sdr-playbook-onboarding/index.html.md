The playbook is the ultimate success tool for an SDR.


Through this training course you will learn:
* What the standards are for an SDR 
* Buyer Personas 
* SDR Framework
* SDR Touch Pattern
* SDR Qualification
* SDR Handoff


It is important that you learn the playbook and how to use it in your job. This is a 3 week training course where you will learn the concepts mentioned above.


Your manager will create an issue for each of the topics above to track the SDRâ€™s progress by copying the content from the [raw markdown source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/raw/master/sourcehttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/sales/sdr/sdr-playbook-onboarding/index.html.md/index.html.md).

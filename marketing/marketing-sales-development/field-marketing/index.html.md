## Field Marketing

The role of field marketing is to identify and support critical sales and marketing opportunities through field marketing avenues and to bring the GitLab brand to life.

## Field Events   

To find out what upcoming events GitLab and our resellers will be involved in please visit our [Events Page](/events/index.html.md/index.html.md). If you have any questions or an event suggestion for us please email `events@gitlab.com`.

### Field Event Goals

- Sales Acceleration
    - Engaging with existing customers
    - New growth opportunities
- Demand
    - Education
- Market Intelligence
    - Test out new messaging or positioning
    - Product Direction

### Event Lifecycle    

#### Evaluating Potential Field Initiatives

- Price/ Budget and what will the ROI be.
- Location - top cities for developers and can we tag on another event or customer meetings?
- Attendees - whoâ€™s attending? Is it the right audience for us? Enterprise vs Community. Will there be decision makers in attendance?
- Size - try to reach a large audience.
- What will our presence be? Who can/ can we go, participate, speak, booth?
- We want to emphasize enterprise events but also remember our community.
- No event participation without lead generation or a speaking slot. Sometimes, we need to pay for a speaking slot if the event is determined to be strategic or can product SCLAU results. That is ok.
- GDPR compliant leads - Lead devices scanning follow up needs to be in event T&C. If GDPR is not in the T&C, we are not allowed to follow up on the leads. Scanning a lead is not automatically GDPR compliant if visitors have not agreed to it. 

##### Suggesting We Sponsor an Event  

- If there is an event or conference you think would be a perfect fit for us to get involved in or sponsor based on the "evaluating and event" criteria above, the process for submitting that suggestion goes as follows:
 1. Please *only request* event support/ sponsorship if your engagement fits the following criteria:
		1. The event will further business aims of GitLab (see event goals/index.html.md).  
	    2. The event has an audience of **250+ people** (the exception being meet-ups - see below for more info on meet-ups/index.html.md)
	    3. The event is a more than a month away.
1. If your event fits the criteria above and you would like support from marketing, create an issue in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/index.html.md) using the Events template.
1. Fill out any relevant information you have and tell us what potential growth opportunities can be gained from investing in this event. Someone from Marketing will be in touch about to discuss your request further within one week.

##### How We Decide Who Attends Which Events?

* FM determines how many staffers we need and if the event is more enterprise focused or community. Enterprise- we try to send more marketing/ sales. Regional Sales Managers select staffer based on who has most potential contacts in area or going to event.  Community - send more developers, subject matter experts, and dev advocates.  
* See who is in the area who might be a good fit for the audience.
* FM lean towards those who might be thought leaders, specialists, or more social in that specific sector.
* FM aims to bring minimal staff to keep costs and disruption to normal workflow low. We take into account what value everyone will provide as well as staffing balance. Please check with your FM rep if you would like to or would like to suggest someone participate in an event. 
* Event staffing list will close 2 weeks before commencement of event. 

#### Where do we keep contracts realted to Field Marketing after they've been signed? 
* All contracts are stored in the Marketing Ops folder. Sorted by year, then by region. 

##### Where can I find out more about how to speak at an event?

- Call for papers are posted in the `#CFP` Channel on Slack. Follow channel for updates on speaking opportunities.
- If you want like to speak somewhere and would like assistance building our your proposal please contact `content@gitlab.com`.

#### Pre-Event   

##### Event Content/ Design

- Assess individual event content needs. Most events will need...
     -  Social copy + design
     -  Social ad or InMail copy + design
     -  Swag designs
     -  Pre and post event talking points for sales outreach
     -  After event wrap up email(s/index.html.md)
     -  Additional blog or content to support event strategy
     -  Targeted slide decks and demos for specific event audience

### Event Outreach

- Email signatures - starting 6 to 4 weeks before event for those attending event and XDR team.
- Get attendee list and contact customers and prospects before event using talking points from content with goal of setting up meetings/ demos at the event. Invite them to anything specific we have happening at or around event.
- If there is not an attendee list process is as follows:
  -  Target speakers for outreach
  -  Utilize previous years attendee list. That person may not be attending, but their colleague might be. Ask for intros. 
  -  Follow event hashtags to see who will be attending
  -  Join local meetup and pre event events (this works well for large events like AWS/index.html.md)
  -  Join LinkedIn Groups and slack channels dedicated to event
  -  Download event app and engage with attendee via app. 
     - You can search for relevant talks and see who has registered for talks that might apply to potential customers. 
- XDRs will help set up in person meetings to occur at event in coordination with assigned account reps.

##### Scheduling Onsite Meetings (pre event/index.html.md)

- There will be a spreadsheet with suggested meeting slots. AE's and XDR's are responsible for adding any meetings they have set with prospects or customers. 
- The AE that sets the meeting will be responsible for completing the designated [client meetings prep sheet](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/blob/master/Client_meetings_prep_template.md/index.html.md). This sheet is intended to provide everyone attending the meeting with any background info on the prospect/ customer they should know going into the meeting, as well as any objectives or things to cover in said meeting. This sheet can be found in Google Docs as well as in every event issue. 
- The AE that sets the meeting will be responsible for creating the contact record in sfdc and adding that contact to the associated campaign. 
- Meetings should be capped at 3-4 GitLabbers in attendance. We want to minimize disruption and get by with only the folks that will be most impactful to the meeting. Avoid million dollar meetings. 
- If an exec is expected to be in meeting, AE will check for interest with prospects or customers and if there is, hand off to the EA team to handle scheduling. EA team owns scheduling **all exec meetings and engagements**
- The AE will provide the EA team with a 1-page background on the meeting (company, attendees, focus for them and focus for GitLab + last minute contact details - phone and email/index.html.md) 1 week prior to the meeting
- The AE that hosted the meeting will be responsible for updating the contact record with notes from the meeting and possibility doing hand off to account owner if they are not owner. 

##### Event Operations Checklist Before Event

- Add event to [events page](/events/index.html.md/index.html.md). Instructions on how to add events can be found [here](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#how-to-add-an-event-to-the-eventsyml/index.html.md)
- Add account based events with a link to a private issue
- Create issue for event in [Marketing Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/issues/index.html.md) on gitlab.com (use [events issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/general/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Event.md/index.html.md)/index.html.md).
- Marketing Programs will setup campaign for event in Salesforce. In the Event issue, include event **budget**, **goals for # of leads** and **expected SCLAU generation**. Other goals should be established and documented in the campaign for # meetings at event, and attendance at planned activities such as VIP dinners, lunches, etc., as applicable.
- Team should add members to campaign to be invited to event, using the appropriate `Campaign Status`:   
     - `Engaged` = You have personally invited the person to the event.
     - `Member` = Marketing will invite the person on your behalf. They will receive invitation email pre-event plus any confirmations/reminders if they register.
     - `Registered` = The system will automatically update to this status once someone completes they form on the Registration Landing page. This is a **system applied status** not for manual additions to a Campaign.
- Set up post event follow up campaigns.
- After Event Survey created and email template ready to go out first work day back after event. Includes details on lead follow-up and how to add business card details.
- Social media to go out during event scheduled.
- Plan for what to do with any remaining swag/collateral.
- Final Event Team prep meeting to go over talking points, assets, and scheduling.

##### Promoting Events Social

- [Use social media](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/social-marketing/#event-promotion/index.html.md) to post as soon as committed to attending an event.
- Possible Targeted Social Ads (media source depends on target audience and attendance goals/index.html.md). Timing depends on call to action.
- Schedule tweets one week before event and one to go out at event promoting presences and any relevant content.

#### At Events/ In the Field
- For events where a field marketing representative cannot be present, he/she will assign an onsite lead. The FM manager will be responsible for coordinating with this person and getting them any info they will need to help run event in their absence. This person will be the venue point of contact as well as responsible for set up and tear down. They will also be in charge of ordering swag from the "small event swag campaign" - see swag section below. A list of their specific responsibilities will be found in the designated event issue.  

##### Employee Booth Guidelines

- Perfect your Pitch 
    - Most people have two ears and one mouth. Successful pitching is two parts listening to one part talking. Be engaged and interested in folks that visit. Be genuinely curious about their story. Understand them first before you start telling them about us.  
    - A great way to start is to offer a handshake and say, 
        1. "Hi, my name is [your_name]â€ 
            1. â€œHi Iâ€™m [their_name]â€ 
        2. â€œ[their_name, are you familiar with GitLab?â€ 
            1. â€œYesâ€ 
                1. â€œThanks for using us, are you using just the source code management or are you also using the built-in GitLab CI/CD?â€ 
            2. â€œNoâ€ - â€œGreat, in a nutshell we <140 character description> - for example, what company do you work for?â€
                1. â€œCompany Xâ€
                2. And whatâ€™s your role at company x? 
                    1. â€œTitle Xâ€ 
                3. Tailor your pitch to their specific experience. Ask about what tools they are using today, what they like or dislike about those tools. 
    - Working at the booth is a great place to try out different ways of explaining technology and trying out different value propositions to see what resonates the most. 
    - Know some stock answers 
    - You can ask them which talk theyâ€™ve heard so far has been the most interesting.
- Close the deal 
    - Figure out what the next step for this person is. Are they a decision maker at a large org?
    - If a conversation is running long, get his/her info and schedule a time to chat or follow up at a later time outside of the booth. The goal of the booth is to make initial contact and connections.
   - Give a personal follow up 
- Stand at the front of booth facing the crowd.
    - Donâ€™t make folks walk into the booth and seek you out. Stand out at the front. Make eye contact and smile at folks walking by. If they stop or pause you can ask them, â€œAre you familiar with GitLab?â€
- Hangout outside the booth.
    - Too many GitLabbers in the booth discourages other folks from coming by. The booth can be a great place to meet up, but donâ€™t hang out there. Move the conversation to a near by lounge or social area.
    - When you are at the booth keep conversation with your coworkers to a minimum. 
    - When you are at the booth focus on serving the attendees. 
    - Do not do normal daily work in the booth - the booth is not a place for taking calls, or responding to emails. When you are at the booth you are on booth duty and that is it. 
- Keep an abundant tidy stash of swag out 
    - During slow times, restock swag and tidy up booth. 
- Keep the booth clean. 
    - The booth should be clean and organized at all times.
- Avoid eating meals in booth, please keep lids on beverages and out of sight.
- If we have the bandwidth or the traffic is slow do not be afraid to walk around to other booths and talk to people. Make friends we could partner with, create interesting content with, or just have friendly beers.
- If press comes to the event feel free to put them in contact with CMO.
- Engage the competition.
    - Be friendly and polite to competitors to come by the booth. 
- Don't forget your business cards.

#### Scanning Best Practices
- Be an active but polite Badge Scanner   
    1. Donâ€™t reach for the badge without first asking if you can scan someones badge and don't lead a conversation with can I scan you. Ask folks politely, â€œWould you appreciate a follow up email?â€ or â€œMind if I scan your badge?â€ Many folks will say, â€œyes.â€ If they say, â€œNot really.â€ You can say, â€œGreat, we donâ€™t want to clutter up your inbox. You can always go online to about.gitlab.com if youâ€™d like to check back in with us.â€ 
    3. Trade scans for all swag if the attendee consents. If we have the space and staff, someone should be in charge of distributing and organizing swag, and scanning folks who come by for swag. 
- Take good notes: 
    1. Your initials (This way the email can be more personalized to say, â€œWe saw you chatted with [name] in the booth.â€/index.html.md) Add your initials + â€œfollow upâ€ if you personally can send them an email within a week of the conference. 
    2. The tech stack (what tools they are using/index.html.md) 
    3.  Any specifics needed in the follow up (schedule a call, send docs for X, interested in Y, etc./index.html.md) 
    4. Tag the lead hot, mild, (cold/index.html.md)
        1. Hot == 
        2. Mild == 
        3. Cold == everyone else. A lead will be cold by default. 
    5. Example 
        1. Wc follow up, JIRA GH Jenkins, send CNCF Case Study. Mild

##### Suggested Attire   

- Wear at least one piece of branded GitLab clothing. If you prefer to wear something dressier than the GitLab branded items available that is also acceptable. Feel free to wear our sticker on your shirt.
- If the conference is business casual try some nice jeans (no holes/index.html.md) or dress pants.
- Clean, closed-toed shoes please.
- A smile.

##### Booth Set Up   

- Bring:
    - Generic business cards
    - Stickers + any other swag
    - Events laptop (for slide show/index.html.md) + charger + dongles
    - Backup power banks
    - Gum
    - One pagers + cheat sheets
    - Dongles

##### Booth Staffing    
- Ideally booth shifts will be around 3 hours or less.
- Staff more people during peak traffic hours.
- Avoid shift changes during peak hours.
- Aim to staff booth with individuals with a variety of expertise and backgrounds- ideally technical and non-technical people from various departments should be paired.
- Send out invites on the Events & Sponsorship calendar to booth staff with the following information:
    - Time and date of event, booth, and shift
    - Suggested attire
    - How he/she can find his/her ticket
    - Any instructions on using or locating lead scanner
    - Let them know of any contests happening
    - How to get a hold of you
    - Link to events handbook
    - Any relevant event set up or clean up

#### Post Event   

- Add event debrief to event issue in marketing project. The debrief should include the following if applicable:
    - Was the event valuable?
        - Would you go again? Should we go again?
        - Did we get good leads/contacts? What was the audience profile like?
        - Best questions asked and conversations. Trends in questions asked.
        - Was our sponsorship/involvement successful? Did we go in at the proper sponsorship level?
    - How was the booth set up?
        - How was the booth staffing?
        - Did the booth get enough traffic?
        - Booth location and size
    - How did our swag go over?
        - Did we have enough/too much?
    - Contests
        - Did the contest(s/index.html.md) effectively build our brand and connecting with our target audience?
- When the list is received from conference, the list will be shared with team & uploaded to SFDC campaign by Mktg OPS.
     - Records that are part of an existing named Account will be assigned to the named Account Owner by default.    
- Data integrity is everyone's responsibility and we ask if you see that an `Account` you own and the **Account Name** does not match what is listed in Salesforce, please correct to match.    
- List upload will be done within 48 hours of list being received by conference organizers. All records will be added to corresponding Salesforce campaign as CONTACTS and either get the status of:    
    - Campaign Member Status = `Member`  & Contact Status = `Raw`: if there are no notes on the spreadsheet    
    - Campaign Member Status = `Engaged` & Contact Status = `Inquiry`: if there is specific follow up or notes on the spreadsheet  
- The `Engaged` CONTACTS are considered **Tier 1** and should be contacted immediately with as much personalization as possible. 
- When the list is uploaded, if any new record is associated to a known account they will be assigned to that Account Owner, but if the record does not belong to any known account they will be enriched using Clearbit. Using the `Total Employee` count & any regional information enriched, assigned as follows:   
    - `Large` = Territory Owner based on location of Company HQ     
    - `Mid-Market` = Appropriate Mid-Market Sales Rep    
    - `SMB` = Appropriate Customer Advocate associate   
    - If record cannot be enriched with enough data to route correctly the record will be assigned to `Sales Admin` for the SDR Leads to review and reassign.  
- The [SDR organization](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/marketing-sales-development/sdr/index.html.md/index.html.md) is responsible for ensuring leads from Field Marketing efforts have the correct [contact status](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/business-ops/#customer-lifecycle/index.html.md) throughout the life of the contact. 
- If the AE/AM would like to do any personalized outreach to event records they will be responsible for coordinating efforts with SDR and documenting any activity and updating statuses in Salesforce. AE's will have one work week to take care of outreach and update the `Contact Status`. If not activity has happened in the first week SDR's will take over outreach.  
- Check for existing account records before engaging contacts. Salesforce *cannot* fuzzy match records and only matches records using the `Email Address` field as the unique identifier. A LeanData workflow will be leveraged to match & merge duplicates or variations but no automated system is perfect.   
- Marketing will send out **one** email to ALL event CONTACTS in Campaign (within 3 business days of event close/index.html.md).   
- The Account Owner or delegated SDR will send a follow up email to their owned account contacts (within 3 business days of event close/index.html.md). The `Contact Status` **must** be updated to reflect [outreach status](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/business-ops/#lead--contact-statuses/index.html.md). 
- FMM campaign owner will check in on campaign and `Contact Status` one week, two weeks, one month, and three months out from event assisting in any additional nurturing efforts to move the needle forward. 

## Terminus Campaigns

- What is terminus and when can I use it?
  - Terminus is a display advertising platform that allows for Account-based marketing using banner advertisements to target people who work at specific companies of our choosing, with the goal of creating general awareness and pushing specific content. It is best used paired with other field strategies to get our foot in the door and build awareness. Not usually used on in isolation to close an opportunity, but can be used to influence it.
  - Creates awareness in specific companies. This tool integrates with Salesforce, so it can only pull from existing accounts in the system. It is best used to target accounts. It can target an industry, specific business and/or a specific department in that company. The platform can get pretty granular in its targeting - please create an issue in the Marketing project to request a campaign. 
- How to suggest a terminus campaign?
  - Go to the marketing project and find the terminus issue template. Add all relevant information. Let us know what companies, industries, or sectors you are trying to target when and paired with what larger field presence.
- The Pipe to Spend team manages Terminus, but Field Marketing contributes to identifying companies and messaging. 

## Swag 
- Swag selection and creation is managed by Corporate Marketing. All information on swag can be found in the [Corporate Marketing handbook](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/corporate-marketing/#swag/index.html.md).

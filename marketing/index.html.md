<br />

<div class="alert alert-purple center"><h3 class="purple"><strong>We <i class="fas fa-heart orange font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitLab</strong></h3></div>

We think GitLab (.com, CE, and EE/index.html.md) is the fastest way for developers, designers, and IT practitioners to turn their ideas into production software. The GitLab Marketing team is here to do the following:

- Meet board approved company goals and metrics.
- Support and celebrate the GitLab community.
- Enable anyone to contribute to our open source products.
- Evangelize the GitLab product in an authentic and helpful way.
- Help each other to achieve our individual and company OKRs.

## Integrated Campaigns

The Marketing department's effort is organized in Integrated Campaigns. An Integrated Campaign is a communication effort that includes several campaign tactics such as blog posts, emails, events, advertisements, content on about.gitlab.com, videos, case studies, whitepapers, surveys, social outreach, and webcasts. An Integrated Campaign will have a campaign theme that summarizes the message we are communicating to our market.    

### Active Campaigns

| Security | Build awareness and educate the market on GitLab's security capabilities | 2018-07-01 | 2019-03-31 |


We track Integrated Campaign results in Salesforce and costs associated with Integrated Campaigns in Netsuite. In Salesforce, Integrated Campaigns are tracked as `parent campaigns` and campaign tactics are tracked as `campaigns`. A campaign tactic will have a `Type` and `Type Detail` to identify the category of effort for the purpose of identifying what types of marketing investment are most efficient in terms of the ratio between customer acquisition cost (CAC/index.html.md) and customer lifetime value (LTV/index.html.md).

Different marketing teams handle different aspects of Integrated Campaigns. Which team are you looking for? Here's what each does.

When working remotely in a fast-paced organization, it is important for a team to agree on a few basic service level agreements on how we would like to work together.

- Try not to email co-workers on weekends. Try out [Boomerang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/index.html.md/index.html.md) and set all your emails to send Monday morning at 6 AM. People will think you're up and working early! Time off is important. We all have stressful weeks so please unplug on the weekends where possible.
- Do not ping someone in a public channel on chat on the weekends. This is rude.

   - If you want a blog post to be published, you should be prepared to write it and format it independently before expecting a review. An easy way to do this is to copy the latest blog post file and edit it, filling in all the fields with your information and post text. Be sure to add a public domain/creative commons cover image, and [attribute properly](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/marketing/blog/#cover-image/index.html.md) at the bottom of the post.

#### Sponsorship

We are happy to sponsor events and meet-ups where a marketing benefit exists, subject to approval by Field Marketing Managers. These sponsorships may be in cash or in kind, depending on individual circumstances.

Organizational or project sponsorships may also be considered where a marketing benefit exists. Typically, these sponsorships will be in kind - e.g., developer time commitments, or [subsidized / free GitLab licenses](/2018/06/05/gitlab-ultimate-and-gold-free-for-education-and-open-source/index.html.md/index.html.md).

Cash sponsorship of projects or organizations may be considered only in exceptional cases - for example, if a project or organization that GitLab depends on is struggling to survive financially.

#### New Ideas for Marketing Campaigns or Events

- Ideas for marketing campaigns
   - We begin by asking: "Who is this for? What do they think? What do we want them to think?
   - If you have a good idea of who the campaign is for and why it would benefit them and us, create an issue in the marketing repo detailing the campaign concept, and tag the content and product marketing teams.
- Ideas for events
  - We are constantly on the look out for high value events, both large and small, to attend or sponsor, in order to engage with our target audiences.
  - If you have an event that you want to recommend we look into, create an issue in the marketing repo describing the event and rationale to attend/sponsor, and tag the field marketing manager.
- Both teams reserve the right to decline, but we love hearing your ideas! Understand that we need to fit every request into a program we‚Äôre running to meet our OKRs, as well as balance the needs of our community and our business.
- If it‚Äôs an item you can execute without much help, you‚Äôre more likely to be given a green light (e.g., a wallpaper that the design team can easily create/index.html.md).

Note: The Marketing Team owns content on marketing pages; do not change content or design of these pages without consulting the Manager, Online Growth. Marketing will request help from product/UX when we need it, and work with them to ensure the timeline is reasonable.

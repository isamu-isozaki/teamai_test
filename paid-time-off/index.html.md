## Paid Time Off

Time away from work can be extremely helpful for maintaining a good work/life balance. GitLab encourages managers and leadership to set the example by taking time off when needed, and ensuring their reports do the same.

A support engineer remarked that â€œIn the 3 months I've been at GitLab, I've taken more time off than the last 2 years at my previous job.â€

Another great example of taking time off is a GitLabber taking a day to do some spring cleaning. Vacations don't have to be trips to exotic places, but instead could be taking some time for oneself at home.

It is so important to take time off to recharge batteries and refresh the mind so you can come back to GitLab with renewed energy and be prepared to do your best work ever!

If you are taking Parental Leave, please see our [Parental Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/#parental-leave/index.html.md).

## A GitLabber's Guide to Time Off

As we all work remotely it can sometimes be difficult to know when and how to plan time off. Here is some advice and guidance on how this can be done in an easy and collaborative way.

1. We have a "no ask" time off policy. This means that:
    * You do not need to ask permission to take time off unless you want to have more than 25 consecutive calendar days off. The 25-day no ask limit is per vacation, not per year. You can have multiple no ask vacations per year that add up to more than 25 days in total; there is no limit to this. What we care about are your results, not how long you work. You are also welcome to take more than 25 days off in one stretch, just make sure to discuss it with your manager first.
    * Always make sure that your job responsibilities are covered while you are away.
    * It can be helpful to take longer breaks to re-energize. If this is helpful to you, we strongly recommended taking at least two consecutive weeks of time off per year.
1. We don't frown on people taking time off, but rather encourage people to take care of themselves and others by having some time away. If you notice that your co-worker is working long hours over a sustained period, you may want to let them know about the time off policy.
1. Working hours are flexible, you are invited to the [company call](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/communication/#company-call/index.html.md) if you are available, but it isn't mandatory and you shouldn't attend if it is during your time off.
1. You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, [take a nap](https://m.signalvnoise.com/sleep-deprivation-is-not-a-badge-of-honor-f24fbff47a75/index.html.md), go grocery shopping, do household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If you have urgent tasks, but something comes up or takes longer than expected, just ensure the rest of the team **knows** and someone can pick up the tasks (assuming you're able to communicate/index.html.md).
1. GitLab encourages team members to volunteer within their community to take care of others.
1. GitLab also encourages you to use your leave for Jury Duty, bereavement leave, or to vote. You are not expected to work during this time off, but we recommend using the [Communication Guidelines](https://about.gitlab.comhttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off/index.html.md) when these situations arise.
1. We encourage all team members to take their country of residence's official holidays off. Using [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/index.html.md/index.html.md), you can see which holidays are considered official by selecting your country, clicking "Change Holidays", and choosing "Official Holidays".
  * We still **help** clients during official days off, unless they are official days off in both the Netherlands and the U.S. For any particular day, we try to always have people working from countries that aren't observing an official holiday. If you need to work during an official day off in your country, you should take a different day off in return.
1. Please also remember to turn on your out of office message and include the contact details of a co-worker in case anything urgent or critical comes into your inbox while you're away. If you have to respond to an incident while on-call outside of your regular working hours, you should feel free to take off some time the following day to recover and be well-rested. If you feel pressured to _not_ take time off to rest, refer to this part of the handbook and explain that you had to handle an incident.

### Communicating Your Time Off
Communicate broadly when you will be away so other people can manage time efficiently, projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that you don't get bothered while away.
1.  Update your own calendar using Google's ["out of office"](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17510656/google-calendar-out-of-office-option/index.html.md) feature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select.
1. Update GitLab.com. By going into your GitLab.com profile and selecting Edit. You can update your status with your out of office dates, if you will be out of the office for more than 48 hours. For Example: 'back on 2018-06-28'. Don't forget to change it back upon your return. Be aware that this information is publicly accessible.
1. If your team or work group has a specific scheduling calendar, ensure to update it with your out of office plans.
1. Decline any meetings you will not be present for so the organizer can make appropriate arrangements.
  * Cancel, move, or find coverage for any meetings for which you are the organizer.
1. You should also adjust your [status in Slack](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/tools-and-tips/#slack-status/index.html.md). Please use the following syntax which uses the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601/index.html.md) date notation in order to avoid confusion: `OOO from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD, please contact XXX for assistance`.
  * Optionally, if you partake in [Donut coffee chat pairings](/culture/remote-only/#coffee-break-calls/index.html.md) you can temporarily â€œsnoozeâ€ them by opening a direct message with Donut and typing `help` to indicate which weeks you won't be able to participate. Pairings will automatically resume when youâ€™re back.
1. If you manage a large team, it may be useful to add your planned time off as a **FYI** on the next agenda of the company call.
1. If you are an interviewer, review your calendar to address any scheduled interviews. To ensure we provide a great candidate experience, if you find that you cannot attend an interview, you will be responsible for finding a replacement interviewer. You must communicate directly with your recruiter, as being out of the office does not always mean that you will be unavailable to interview.
1. If you're one of the people who typically handle availability emergencies (the on-call heroes/index.html.md), you **do** need to ensure that someone will be available to cover for you while you're out of office. You can check for this with your manager. Managers can import their team's calendars into their Google Calendar to get a quick view of their team members' availability.
1. Being part of a global remote team means you need to be highly organized and a considerate team player. Each team has busy times so it is always a good idea to check with them to ensure there is adequate coverage in place.
1. Please see the [On-Call](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/on-call/index.html.md/index.html.md) page for information on how to handle scheduled leave for someone from the On-Call team.

### Managementâ€™s Role in Paid Time Off

Managers have a duty of care towards their direct reports in managing their wellbeing and ensuring that time off is being taken. Sometimes, when working remotely from home, a good work-life balance can be difficult to find. It is also easy to forget that your team is working across multiple timezones, so some may feel obligated to work longer to ensure there is overlap. It is important that you check-in with your reports through one-to-ones, and if you think someone needs some time off let them know they can do this.

If you discover that multiple people in your team want to be off at the same time, see what the priorities are, review the impact to the business, and use your best judgement. Discuss this with your team so you can manage the time off together. It is also a good idea to remind your team to give everyone an early heads-up, if possible, about upcoming vacation plans.

### Recognizing Burnout

It is important for us to take a step back to recognize and acknowledge the feeling of being "burned out".
We are not as effective or efficient when we work long hours, miss meals or forego nurturing our personal lives
for sustained periods of time. If you feel that you or someone on your team may be experiencing [burnout](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642/index.html.md), be sure to address it right away.

To get ahead of a problem, be sure to communicate with your manager if any of the following statements ever apply to you:

* "I am losing interest in social interaction." - This is especially dangerous in an all-remote setting.
* "I've lost the motivation to work." - Everyone has days when they don't want to work
but if you hear yourself saying this often, you're on the road to burnout.
* "I often feel tired." - Indicative of being overworked for prolonged periods of time.
* "I get agitated easily."
* "I've been hostile to my coworkers." - You see yourself "snap" at people for
no apparent reason.
* "I've been having headaches often." - A headache can manifest itself for multiple
reasons but if you catch yourself only having headaches on work days, it is time to
evaluate your situation.

If someone is showing signs of burnout, they should take time off to focus on things that are relaxing and improve their overall health and welfare.

As a manager, it is your task to evaluate your team's state of mind.
Address possible burnout by discussing options with your team member to manage contributing stressors and evaluate the workload.
Some things to help with this:

* Try to follow each of your team members' work habits. If they start being less efficient,
or working more hours, they might be on the road to burnout.
* Try to keep track of when they had their last paid day off. If they hadn't had a personal day
in a long time, look closer at their behaviour.
* Make sure you let your team members know they can talk to you about their challenges.
* When you recognize symptoms of burnout in others, help them to get out the "Burnout trap".
Don't just tell people to [take a break](https://medium.com/@zenpeacekeeper/take-a-break-f877907877bc/index.html.md),
but help them arrange things so they **can** take a break. Ask why they feel they can't take a break
(there are almost certainly real, concrete reasons/index.html.md) and then ask permission to get busy putting things in place
that will overcome those barriers. People might be trapped by their own fatigue, being too worn out to find the creative solutions needed to take a break.

Other [tips to avoid burnout](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642?pg=2/index.html.md) include:
* Assess and pursue your interests, skills and passions.
* Take breaks during the day to eat healthy food and stretch your legs. The [Timeout app](http://dejal.com/timeout/index.html.md/index.html.md) can help with that.
* Make time each day to increase blood and oxygen circulation which improves brain activity and functionality.
* Get plenty of restful sleep.
* Meditate to take your mind away from work. [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/science/index.html.md) and [Calm](https://www.calm.com/meditate/index.html.md) are good tools for creating meditation habits.
* Don't start work as soon as you wake up. Take your time doing your morning routine.
* Set yourself as away when you are not working. Snooze your Slack notifications. It is
fine to be not reachable during your off time.

Don't let burnout creep up on you. Working remotely can allow us to create bad habits, such as working straight through lunch to get something finished. Once in a while this feels good, perhaps to check that nagging task or big project off the list, but don't let this become a bad habit. Before long, you'll begin to feel the effects on your body and see it in your work.

Keep in mind that you are not alone! Chances are that you have a colleague who already
experienced burnout or has been on the road to burnout. Schedule coffee calls with
your team members or with anyone you'd like to talk to. Talk to your manager. If none of that
is an option for you, schedule a coffee call with [Marin](slack://user?team=T02592416&id=U025925R0/index.html.md).

Take care not to burn yourself out!

### Processing Vacation Requirements

1. People Ops will export the availability calendar monthly using the "Shared Calendar" sheet on the google drive, and add any applicable entries to BambooHR under Time Off. Employees with an accrual in BambooHR should review the entries from People Ops to ensure accuracy.
1. Each June, People Ops will need to review the BV (Netherlands/index.html.md) Accrual for all employees and remove any carry over from the previous calendar year that was not used.
1. In January, People Ops will adjust any negative carryover back to zero, for all accruals in BambooHR for the year. To do this go to Time Off, Adjust Balance, and add any extra days.

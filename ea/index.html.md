## Meeting request requirements

If you want to schedule a meeting, email the EA the following:
* Must have/optional attendees (keep in mind that the more must haves, the harder to schedule/more time needed)

* Urgency: in the next two days, in the next week or two, etc
* Duration: 25 mins, 50 mins, etc.
* Provide context: include topic, agenda to be covered. Share google doc if available to be included in invite

In case you have a **same day** request, you can send the same information in the "ea-team" Slack channel. If not, you don't have to ping us on Slack if you already sent the email.


### Formats for invites

## General scheduling guidelines

* You can add other [calendars](calendar.google.com) on the left, to see when GitLab team members are free to schedule a meeting with
* Use for example a tool like [Skyscanner](www.skyscanner.com) to find different flight options with most airlines when needing to book travel
<br>
<br>
* Schedule calls in European timezones in the morning (am) Pacific (Daylight) Time and US time zones in the afternoon (pm) Pacific (Daylight) Time

* Holds on the schedule should be removed at least 15 minutes before the preceeding meeting starts.
* Monthly video calls are 25 minutes while quarterly calls/dinners are scheduled for 90 minutes plus any necessary travel time.
* If the call is with any Google company, use Hangouts instead of Zoom.
* Meetings in the boardroom with another guest joining via videocall. The EA will schedule an additional ten minutes before the appointment to test the system.
<br>
<br>
* For meetings or lunch/dinner appointments, always make sure to add the address in the invite of the location where it’s scheduled.
* Make sure to plan travel time (in a separate calendar item, just for the exec) before and after the meeting in case another meeting or call should follow.
* Sales meetings are important. If the CEO can help the process, feel free to include him in the meeting by working with the EA on this.

## E Group In-person Meetings and Board Meetings

There should be one invite for all attendees that includes the following:

* Exact meeting time blocked (ie: Start at 9am PST, End at 5pm PST)
* Zoom Link for remote participants
* Agenda (the agenda should also include the zoom link at the top)

Make sure to:

* Test Zoom setup at least 1 hour before and at most 2 days before
* Ensure remote participants feel invited and welcomed

## Email

* Labels: /archive, /respond or /urgent-important
* Prepare draft responses
* Standard reply for recruiters:
“We do not accept solicitations by recruiters, recruiting agencies, headhunters, and outsourcing organizations. Please find all info [on our jobs page](/jobs/#no-recruiters)

## Physical Mail

* Check all incoming (physical) mail at 1233 Howard Street and sort the urgent and important letters.
* Inform AP if invoices came in.
* Inform other people/departments if mail is addressed for them and include a scan of the document.

## Travel

EA's do research for the best option for a flight and propose this before booking.
Make sure to add a calendar item for 2 hours before take off for check in and add a separate one for travel time before that in the exec's calendar.
If a flight was changed or not taken due to delays or other circumstances, make sure to check with the airline for the current flight status.

## Expensify

* When you’re logged in, you can find wingman account access for other team members in the top right corner menu.
* Check their email (if you have access), using the search bar in the top, to find any receipts for the postings in the current expense report.
* And/or write down what receipts are missing and email to request them if needed.

## Scheduling preferences for Sid Sijbrandij, CEO

* Don't schedule over the Infrastucture team call unless approved
* Mark the events listed in [Google Calendar section](/handbook/communication/#google-calendar) of the handbook as 'Private'
* The [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187Q355Q4IvrJ-uayVamoQmh0aXZ6eixAOE90jZspAY4/edit?ts=574610db&pli=1) of items to be handled by Sid's EA
* Monthly video calls are 25 minutes while quarterly calls/dinners are scheduled for 90 minutes plus any necessary travel time.
* After each meeting with a potential investor, make sure to update the sheet with the information on these meetings (to be found in the agenda doc for Sid's EA)
* Follow up on introductions from certain recipients (board, investors) immediately without asking for approval.
* If Sid is meeting with a potential hire, make sure to create a profile in our ATS before the meeting for Sid to take notes during the call.

<br>
* If Sid has a **ride or walks** to an appointment, make sure to **add 5 minutes extra** to find the address and sign in at reception.
* If Sid is **driving himself**, make sure to **add 15 minutes extra** for random occurences such as traffic, stopping for gas or parking.
* If Sid is **driving himself** to a meeting, he likes to plan phone calls to catch up with the team. Check with him who he'd like to talk with during his commute and schedule accordingly.
* Due to a busy schedule Sid has a preference of meeting setup: First try for a video call or  a meeting in the GitLab boardroom. If the other party presses to meet at their location, confirm if that is OK before accepting.

### Travel preferences
Current preferences for flights are:
* Aisle seat
* Check a bag for all trips longer than one night
* Frequent Flyer details of all (previously flown) airlines are in EA vault of 1Password as well as important passport/visa info

### Pick your brain meetings

If people want advice on open source, remote work, or other things related to GitLab we'll consider that. If Sid approves of the request we suggest the following since we want to make sure the content is radiated as wide as possible.:

1. We send an email: "Thanks for being interested in GitLab. If we schedule a meeting it will follow the format on /handbook/ceo/#pick-your-brain-meetings Are you able to submit a draft post with us within 48 hours of interview?"
1. If we receive a positive answer we schedule a 50 minute Zoom video call or [visit to our boardroom](/visiting/) that is recorded by us, uploaded to Youtube as a private video, and shared with you.
1. Within 48 hours you share a draft post with us in a Google Doc with suggestion or edit rights for anyone that knows the url.
1. You can redact anything you don't want to publish.
1. Our content department will work with you to publish the post within the agreed timeframe.
1. A great examples of this in action are the first two times we did this [/2016/07/14/building-an-open-source-company-interview-with-gitlabs-ceo/](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12615723) and [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12615723](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12615723). Both got to nr. 1 on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

The EA-team will create an issue once it's scheduled with the label [ceo-interview on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues?label_name=ceo-interview&scope=all&state=all) should follow up to make sure the draft post is submitted.

Reply to emails: Thanks for wanting to chat. I propose we meet in the format proposed on /handbook/ceo/#pick-your-brain-meetings so that other people benefit from our conversation too. If you're up for that please work with Kirsten (cc:) to schedule a time and location.

Alternatively we can also make it a YouTube live event, people can ask us questions in the chat during the event, and we can share the recording later.

## Scheduling for Barbie Brewer, CCO

* Meetings according to time zone. Try to keep mornings free for people in GMT+
* On the weeks Barbie has her kids she will doing school drop off and pick up. If needed - she can take calls during pick up 3:45-4:15pm but can’t do video.
* Barbie likes when she can have free time (30 minutes) between 4:30-5pm to help the kids with homework, but it isn’t required.
* Hours between 7am-8:30am (M,T,TH,F) 8-9:30am (W)  5-8pm are sacred for family time on the weeks she has the kids. On Wednesdays her kids don’t start school until 9:15am so she leaves the house around 9am to drop them off and is usually home by 9:15am. 
* Barbie loves reminders - upcoming meetings that she may need to prep for. Out of office email responders, etc (ie: PeopleOps FGU, PeopleOps Monthly Metrics, PeopleOps 101, etc).
* Ensure Calendar is up to date on out of office days to cancel, decline, and reschedule meetings
* All Meetings should have personal zoom link
* All E-Group meetings should have a Zoom link and accurate times in the invite
* On Slack in # valley - ping once a month to see if interest in lunches


## Scheduling for Michael McBride, CRO

* Prefers “appropriate length” conversations, so short meetings are okay on the calendar.  If a topic only needs 10 mins, book 10 mins instead of 30, etc.
* He also almost always runs late ;-)
* Include Meeting Agendas in invites / make sure the team knows to include this with requests for time.
* Flexible with late evening calls for Asia or Australia - check with him first. 
* Add pre-emptive blocks in calendar that can be used for meetings or calls.
* Add an hour a day for work time - title “workflow”. This is time for email follow-up and general work time. If the time has to move to accommodate another meeting ensure another time is found and that it can still happen.

## Scheduling for Eric Johnson, VPE

* 1:1 Meeting title format: “Person:Eric 1:1”
* Tick the box “Attendees can modify”
* Please create an additional reminder (besides the default 10min pop-up) that is 1 day. Email (reminds me to go into the doc and populate notes)
* Use Personal Zoom for meetings with the exception of back to back meetings. Please ensure there is another Zoom link.
Note: Eric will attach private 1:1 docs to the meeting series once they are created.
* Eric will block off personal appointments and family related blocks. 
* Add holds when scheduling meetings and interviews so he knows it's being worked on.
* If meetings need to happen before 8am PT or after 6pm PT check with him directly.
* Eric likes updates and/or questions via Slack.

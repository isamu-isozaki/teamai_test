## Introduction
At GitLab, Slack is critical to our communication with each other.  While it enables real-time communication, we also are careful to remain true to our asynchronous mindset, suggesting that GitLabbers set "do not disturb" and not expect real-time answers from others all the time.

There are groups of channels that can help with various areas of GitLab.  This page speaks to a few subsets of those channel groups.

## Channels

### General Channels

There are a lot of general channels, just to name a few:

* **[`#general`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/general/index.html.md)**: General announcements and company-wide broadcasts
* **[`#questions`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/questions/index.html.md)**: Ask all of GitLab for help with any question you have... and then go document it after you find the answer :/index.html.md)
* **[`#thanks`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/thanks/index.html.md)**: Where GitLabbers can [say thanks](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/communication/#say-thanks/index.html.md) to those GitLabbers who did a great job, helped a customer, or helped you!
* **[`#random`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/random/index.html.md)**:  Socialize and share random snippets with your fellow GitLabbers.

### Channel Categories

#### Feature Channels (f_/index.html.md)

These channels are for teams and GitLabbers interested in a specific feature that exists in GitLab or is being built today!

**Examples**

* **[`#f_web_ide`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/f_web_ide/index.html.md)**: Share ideas and feedback about our [Web IDE](/2018/06/15/introducing-gitlab-s-integrated-development-environment/index.html.md/index.html.md) 
* **[`#f_ldap`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/f_ldap/index.html.md)**: Talk about our integration with [LDAP providers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/ldap.html/index.html.md). 

#### Group Channels (g_/index.html.md)

Group channels (prefixed with a `g_`/index.html.md) correspond to a [DevOps Stage group](/team/structure/#stage-groups/index.html.md) and other [engineering departments and teams](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/engineering/#engineering-departments--teams/index.html.md).

**Example**

* **[`#g_create`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_create/index.html.md)**: Channel for the [Create](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/categories/#create/index.html.md) development group.
* **[`#g_geo`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_geo/index.html.md)**: Dedicated to the [Geo group](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/engineering/dev-backend/geo/index.html.md/index.html.md).

#### Location Channels (loc_/index.html.md)

These channels are used to help GitLabbers who are in the same general region of the world to talk about get-togethers and other location-specific items. They are also instrumental if you're going to be visiting somewhere else in the world - there might be a GitLabber or two nearby! Feel free to join the channel temporarily to chat with GitLabbers who live there, and see if there is an opportunity to leverage the [visiting grant](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/incentives/#visiting-grant/index.html.md) to add value to your trip.

**Examples**

* **[`#loc_nashville`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/loc_nashville/index.html.md)**: Chat with the GitLabbers in Nashville, Tennessee, USA     
* **[`#loc_portugal`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/loc_portugal/index.html.md)**: A channel for GitLabbers in the entire contry of Portugal! 

#### Internal Customer Channels (-internal/index.html.md)

Many customers that require coordination across GitLab teams have dedicated channels in slack to discuss that customer's needs internally. Those channels are all postfixed with `-internal`

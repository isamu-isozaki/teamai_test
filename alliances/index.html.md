## Open to collaboration

GitLab is an open product with a Core, open-source edition, and a enterprise, open-core edition, with additional features that are closed-sourced. We're open to integrations with companies and tools that are interested in harnessing GitLab's platform capabilities, user flows and data with their products. If you want to talk to us about a partnership you can contact [Brandon Jung](mailto:bjung@gitlab.com/index.html.md), our VP Alliances.


## Partner definitions

### Services partners

Primary monetization is through the sale of services.  This can be a one-time implementation, ongoing support, or outsourcing.
1. Global Systems Integrators - have a large global workforce and can deliver on almost any customer need. Examples: Accenture, Deloitte, TCS, Wipro
1. Regional Systems Integrators - large workforce but with single continental focus and a more limited offering of services. Examples: CI&T, Slalom
1. Boutique Systems Integrators - very focused DevOps partners that could be deep experts on GitLab and the nuances of getting it setup and running it. Examples - Managed Service Providers - provide ongoing support for solutions/applications. Examples: Rackspace

### Channel partners

Primary monetization is through reselling GitLab.
1. VAR/VAD - Channel services including resale, implementation, contracting, support, financing etc.
1. DMR -  primary business is resale of the software, often does not implement.  Value are the contracts that these partners have in place with customers.
1. Training Partners - focus on training teams

### Technology partners

Primary monetization is through the sales of software licensing/support that integrates with GitLab
1. Upstream Technology Partners. Examples: JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Slack, Cloudability
1. Integrated/Competitive Technology Partners. Examples: Jenkins, Codeship, Shippable, TeamCity, Atlassian. Need very clear agreement from sales, product, and engineering on how we prioritize working with these partners.  
1. Downstream/Platform Technology Partners. Examples: AWS, Google, Azure, IBM, Salesforce
1. Sell-to Technology Partners - Most of CNCF and majority of tech partners.

### Additional criteria

1. Exposure - Partnerships which generate more exposure to new segments of audiences, integrations are a good example of that.
1. Product usage familiarity - more people using GitLab but not necessarily installing their own instance, open source projects as an example.
1. Adoption - partnerships attracting more people to adopt GitLab for their own instance.
1. Revenue - Revenue generating partnerships
1. Strategic - partners we find will add strategic value to our long term positioning.

In keeping with our values of results, freedom, efficiency, frugality, and boring solutions, we expect GitLabbers to take responsibility to determine what they need to purchase or expense in order to do their jobs effectively. We don't want you to have to wait with getting the items that you need to get your job done. You most likely know better than anyone else what the items are that you need to be successful in your job. The guidelines below describe what people in our team commonly expense.

1. Spend company money like it is your **own** money. _No, really_.
1. You don't have to [ask permission](https://m.signalvnoise.com/if-you-ask-for-my-permission-you-wont-have-my-permission-9d8bb4f9c940/index.html.md) before making purchases **in the interest of the company**. When in doubt, do **inform** your manager before the purchase, or as soon as possible after the purchase.
1. It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask People Ops (and in turn, People Ops should update the list/index.html.md).
1. It is generally easiest and fastest for you to make the purchases yourself, but feel free to reach out to People Ops if you would like help in [acquiring some items](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#ordering-supplies/index.html.md). Just include a link and your shipping address in an email, and People Ops will be happy to place the order.
1. You may privately use GitLab property, a MacBook for example, to check your private e-mails or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm GitLab, or interfere with [Intellectual Property](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/general-guidelines/#sts=Intellectual Property/index.html.md).
1. If you make a purchase that will cost GitLab $1000 USD (or over/index.html.md), this is classed as company property, you will be required to return the item(s/index.html.md) if you leave the company.
1. Employees: file your expense report no later than 7 days after the end of the calendar quarter that you made the purchase in. Contractors: include receipts with your invoices.
1. Any non-company expenses paid with a company credit card will have to be reported to your manager as soon as possible and **refunded** in full within 14 days.
1. **Items.** The company will pay for the following items if you **need it for work or use it mainly for business**, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring payroll taxes. Items paid for by the company are property of the company and need to be reported with serial numbers etc. to People Ops for proper [asset tracking](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/finance/asset-tracking/index.html.md/index.html.md). Since these items are company property, you do not need to buy insurance for them unless it is company policy to do so (for example, at the moment we do not purchase Apple Care/index.html.md), but you do need to report any loss or damage to PeopleOps as soon as it occurs. Links in the list below are to sample items, other options can be considered. It's also recommended to consult the `#questions` channel in slack on the latest recommendations other GitLabbers have been purchasing:
    *  Notebook:
        * If you live in the U.S., please check with your manager before purchasing a notebook as we may already have one in inventory that can be shipped to you.
          * Engineers - We recommend getting a [MacBook Pro 15-inch retina with 512GB of storage and 16GB of memory](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/15-inch/index.html.md) or similar.
          * Product Managers and Solutions Architects - We recommend getting a [MacBook Pro 13-inch retina with 256GB of storage and 16GB of memory](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch/index.html.md)
          * Others - We recommend getting a [MacBook Pro 13-inch retina with 256GB of storage and 8GB of memory](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch/index.html.md)
        * Mention to the Apple Store that you are buying it for GitLab so that we can qualify for [business discounts](http://www.apple.com/business/vpp/index.html.md/index.html.md), 7% on all Macbooks, 3% on iPhones/iPads, and 10% off accessories, except for the apple watch, Bose products, and apple pencil. This discount only applies to stores in the UK and the US. Note that not all stores in the UK or US can honor this discount. If that is the case for your store, please reach out to People Ops for how to proceed. Note also that the discount cannot be applied during an online purchase. If you would like to purchase over the phone you may want to consult with People Ops first so that they can give you answers to questions that Apple salespeople might ask.
        * We do not allow the purchase of any Windows machines. Windows makes it harder to work with git and ruby from the command line, and Windows has too many security risks associated with it.
        * We strongly encourage Macs, but for Developers and Production Engineers _only_ we do allow Linux. Note that [1Password](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/security/#1password-guide/index.html.md) does not yet have a native client for Linux, but [there is a browser extension](https://support.1password.com/getting-started-1password-x/index.html.md/index.html.md).
        * Many team members can use their company issued laptop until it breaks. If your productivity is suffering, you can request a new laptop. The typical expected timeframe for this is about three years, but it can depend on your usage and specific laptop.
    *  [USB-C Adapter for New Macbooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VU2K10G/index.html.md/index.html.md)
    *  [Notebook carrying bag](http://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-Hustle-Backpack-Royal/dp/B00OQSL6LO/index.html.md/index.html.md)

    *  [Portable 15" external monitor](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-MB169B-1920x1080-Portable-Monitor/dp/B013XFJKGI/index.html.md/index.html.md) ([USB-C version](https://www.amazon.com/MB169C-1920x1080-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B01C83BE06/index.html.md/index.html.md) for new MacBooks/index.html.md)

    *  [Ethernet connector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FFJ0RKE/index.html.md/index.html.md)
    *  [Earpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug/index.html.md) are strongly recommended instead of using notebook speakers and microphones since these can cause an echo.
    *  [Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JILE/index.html.md/index.html.md) these Koss UR40 are semi-open, adjustable, and lightweight so they are more comfortable to wear for longer periods, please use with an external microphone.

    *  [Ergonomic chair](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Furniture-Executive-Swivel-Flip-Up/dp/B012JJ2EEY/index.html.md/index.html.md) ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/Topstar-OP290UG20-Syncro-Bandscheiben-Drehstuhl-Deluxe-schwarz/dp/B00M6AJWHY/index.html.md/index.html.md)/index.html.md)

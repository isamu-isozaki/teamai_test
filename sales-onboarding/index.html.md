**Sales Onboarding Process**

Sales onboarding at GitLab includes product, sales and process training, new employee setup, and a long list of actions for the first 30 days you are on the team.  Every employee gets a customized project with all of the steps they need to complete to be fully onboarded.  

The template that your manager and people ops use as the basis for this customized onboarding is in the [People Ops onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md/index.html.md)

{: #reach-peopleops}

Welcome to the People Operations handbook! You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here. You can also check out [pages related to People Operations](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/#other-pages-related-to-people-operations/index.html.md) in the next section below. If you can't find what you're looking for please do the following:

- [**The People Ops Group**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/index.html.md) holds several subprojects to organize people operations; please create an issue in the appropriate subproject or `general` if you're not sure. Please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to GitLabbers. Similarly, if your question can be shared please use a public issue. Tag `@gl-peopleops` or `gl-hiring` so the appropriate team member can follow up.
  * Please note that not all People Ops projects can be shared in an issue due to confidentiality. When we cannot be completely transparent, we will share in the issue description what we can share and why.
  * [**Employment Issue Tracker**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/issues/index.html.md): only Onboarding, Offboarding, and Interview Training Issues are held in this subproject and are created by People Ops.
- [**Chat channel**](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/peopleops/index.html.md); please use the `#peopleops` chat channel for questions that don't seem appropriate for the issue tracker. With questions for our recruiting team, please use the mention `@recruitingteam`; for general People Operations questions, please use the mention `@peoplegeneral`.
- If you need to discuss something that is confidential/private, you can send an email to the People Operations group (see the "Email, Slack, and GitLab Groups and Aliases" google doc for the alias/index.html.md).
- If you only feel comfortable speaking with one team member, you can ping an individual member of the People Operations team, as listed on our [Team page](/team/index.html.md/index.html.md).
- If you need help with any technical items, for example, 2FA, please reach out to Support via email or slack.

## Role of People Operations
{: #role-peopleops}

In general, the People Operations team and processes are here as a service to the rest of the team; helping make your life easier so that you can focus on your work and contributions to GitLab. On that note, please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/#reach-peopleops/index.html.md) with questions! In the case of a conflict between the company and a team member, People Operations works "on behalf of" the company.

## Team Directory
{: #directory}

GitLab uses Slack profiles as an internal team directory, where team members can add their personal contact details, such as email, phone numbers, or addresses. This is your one-stop directory for phone numbers and addresses (in case you want to send your team mate an awesome card!/index.html.md). Feel free to add your information to your Slack profile (this is completely opt-in!/index.html.md) by clicking on "GitLab" at the top left corner of Slack, "Profile & Account", then "Add Profile" (for the first time making changes/index.html.md) or "Edit Profile" (if your account is already set up/index.html.md) to make any changes!

- Please make sure that your address and phone information are written in such a way that your team mates can reach you from a different country. So, for example, include `+[country code]` in front of your phone number.

## Birthday Swag

BambooHR should send an email to People Ops the day before and the day of a team member's birthday. Celebrate by sending the team member an email (template below/index.html.md) and post on the `#celebrations` channel on Slack so all team members can help them celebrate. GitLabbers with weekend birthdays will be wished a Happy Birthday on the following weekday.

Birthday Email Template: "Happy Birthday! Please use this link [insert link] to redeem your birthday swag! You will need to login or create an account with the swag store to receive your free birthday socks! The username will be your GitLab email. Once you are are in the store you should see your options to order GitLab birthday socks. Please let People Ops know if you have any questions."

The link for the swag store birthday campaign is located in the People Ops vault in 1Password.

Monitor the swag store open orders to place orders that team members have entered for birthday swag.

## Letter of Employment and Reference Request

If you need a letter from GitLab verifying your employment/contractor status, please send the request to People Ops citing what information is needed. We will provide most recent title, dates of employment, and salary information. We will also verify, but not provide National Identification Numbers. People Ops will send you the letter once it is completed. In addition, if the request comes from a third party, People Ops will always verify that the information is appropriate to share. If you are a US Employee you can follow these [instructions](https://drive.google.com/a/gitlab.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPYlZ4RWNpaFZHRU1UYjJJdmxXaUlFLTJ0OXhB/view?usp=sharing/index.html.md) for an automated verification through TriNet.

GitLabbers are not authorized by the company to speak on its behalf to complete reference requests for GitLabbers no longer working for GitLab. If a team member would like to give a personal reference based on their experience with the former team member, it must be preceded by a statement that the reference is not speaking on behalf of the company. To reinforce this fact, personal references should never be on company letterhead and telephone references should never be on company time. You do not need permission from GitLab to give a personal reference. Remember to always be truthful in reference check and try not to give a majority negative reference; instead refuse to provide one. Negative references can result in legal action in some jurisdictions.

If an ex team member acted in a malicious way against GitLab we'll do a company wide announcement on the company call not to provide a reference.

## Boardroom addresses
{: #addresses}

- For the SF boardroom, see our [visiting](/visiting/index.html.md/index.html.md) page.
- For the NL office, we use a postbox address listed in the "GitLab BV address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password. We use [addpost](https://www.addpost.nl/index.html.md) to scan our mail and send it along to a physical address upon request. The scans are sent via email to the email alias listed in the "Email, Slack, and GitLab Groups and Aliases" google doc.
- For the UK office, there is a Ltd registered address located in the "GitLab Ltd (UK/index.html.md) Address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password
- For the Germany office, there is a GmbH address located in the "GitLab GmbH Address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password

## Business Cards

If you need business cards, please [send a request via Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdstKb6nfh9SxxcGUlbxypLeIBPvncJDqQMuDMJwqPSvDjmmQ/viewform?usp=sf_link/index.html.md). Someone on the team will place the order and email you with confirmation. 

- If you need them for an event, please also include the date by which you need them delivered. 
- The default order is for 50 cards unless otherwise noted, so if you need more please add a note in the form.

## NPS Surveys

NPS stands for "Net Promoter Score". GitLab has two forms of NPS surveys: eNPS for all employees (where "e" stands for "Employee"/index.html.md), and an onboarding NPS. These surveys gauge employee satisfaction and how likely employees are to recommend GitLab to others as a place to work.

People Ops will send out an eNPS survey twice yearly to all employees.

The onboarding NPS survey is a 60-day survey for new hires. To help People Ops understand your experience and improve the onboarding process, please complete the [onboarding survey](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU8qxThxRu3tdrExFGBJ1GlyucCoJj2kDpcvOlM4AiRGOavQ/viewform/index.html.md) after you have been working for GitLab for at least 2 months. People Ops will send reminders to team members to complete the survey.

## Gifts

People Operations will send flowers for a birth, death, or significant event of a team member. This policy applies to an immediate relationship to the GitLab team member. Management can send a request to People Operations in order to ensure that a gift is sent in the amount of [75-125 USD](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/global-compensation/#exchange-rates/index.html.md).

## Using BambooHR

We use [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com/index.html.md) to keep all team member information
in one place. All team members (all contract types/index.html.md) are in BambooHR.
We don't have one contact person but can call BambooHR if we want any changes made in the platform. The contact info lives in the Secretarial Vault in 1Password.

Some changes or additions we make to BambooHR require action from our team members.
Before calling the whole team to action, prepare a communication to the team that is approved by the Chief Culture Officer.

Team Members have employee access to their profile in BambooHR and should update any data that is out-dated or incorrect. If there is a field that cannot be updated, please reach out the the People Ops Analyst with the change.

## Using RingCentral

Our company and office phone lines are handled via RingCentral. The login credentials
are in the Secretarial vault on 1Password. To add a number to the call handling & forwarding
rules:

- From the Admin Portal, click on the Users button (menu on left/index.html.md), select the user for which you
want to make changes (for door handling, pick extension 101/index.html.md).
- A menu appears to the right of the selected user; pick "Call Handling & Forwarding" and review
the current settings which show all the people and numbers that are alerted when the listed User's
number is dialed.
- Add the new forwarding number (along with a name for the number/index.html.md), and click Save.

## WBSO (R&D tax credit/index.html.md) in the Netherlands

For roles directly relating to Research and Development in the Netherlands, GitLab may be eligible for the [WBSO (R&D Tax Credit/index.html.md)](http://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/wbso/index.html.md). For more information, contact the WBSO People Ops rep.

## Paperwork people may need to obtain mortgage in the Netherlands

When your employment contract is for a fixed period of time (e.g. 12 months/index.html.md) you'll need a "werkgeversverklaring".
This document describes your salary and states that your employer expects to continue to employ
you after the contract expires (assuming the performance of the employee doesn't degrade/index.html.md).
This document has to be filled in by hand, preferably using blue ink, and must be signed
and stamped. If there is no stamp (as is the case for GitLab/index.html.md) an extra letter (also signed/index.html.md)
must be supplied that states the employer has no stamp. While the language of these
documents doesn't matter, the use of Dutch is preferred.

Employees also have to provide a copy of a payslip that clearly states not only their
monthly salary but also their annual salary. These numbers must match the numbers on
the "werkgeversverklaring" down to the decimals. Mortgage providers may also require
you to provide information about your financial status, usually in the form of a report/screenshot
of your total financial status (including any savings you have/index.html.md). The requirements for
this seem to vary a bit between mortgage providers.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Learning & Development (L&D/index.html.md) page at GitLab! L&D is an essential part of any organization's growth, success and overall business strategy. We want to support the development of our GitLabbers' competencies, skills and knowledge by providing them with the tools they need and also the opportunities to progress their own personal and professional development.  

## What is Career Development

Career development is the lifelong process of managing learning, work, leisure and transitions in order to move toward a personally determined and evolving preferred future.

70-20-10 Rule for Development

70% of your development should come from on-the-job and action learning.  This can include development experiences like managing a project, serving on a cross-funcational team, taking on a new task, job shadowingg, job rotation, etc.

20% of your development should come from interactions with others.  This includes having a mentor, being a mentor, coaching, participating in communities of practice, serving as a leader in your organization, etc.

10% of your development should come from training, including classes, seminars, webinars, podcasts, reading, conferences, etc.

Additional Questions to Think About

- Do you have any overused strengths or underdeveloped skills that might cause your career to stall or derail?
- Considering feedback from others, are you percieved to have the skills required for the business needs of the future? If not, how could you shape that perception in a favorable direction?
- How can you leverage your current skills and talents for your future aspirations?
- What skills or talents are missing to qualify you for your future aspirations?
- Does your feedback from others tell you anything about how feasible your aspirations are?
- Do you currently have the skills and talents needed for the future business needs?  If not what can you do now to get ready?

## Career Mapping and Development
{:#career-mapping-and-development}

We have started this process at GitLab by defining Junior, Senior and Staff advancement levels. Career Mapping helps GitLabbers to understand and develop the skills they need to achieve their goals, giving them clear criteria.  
Mapping helps managers and leaders internally develop the skills and knowledge they need to achieve future business goals. The key to this is to identify the key skills, knowledge, and abilities needed to master each level. Another essential tool is a career development plan, here are some examples:

 - [UX Team Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GugUY_vPMERSP7QvQ7kaUrsaFn84YFipQtPZ1f5i_Q4/edit#gid=1712199154/index.html.md)
- [Career Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJIzMnVhEz3X4k24oAwNnlgGhBeQ518Cps9kLVRRoWQ/edit/index.html.md)
- [Template  - Development Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DBrukzzsV6InaCkZf8_ngLeTcLQ9uj6ynE93qLmHkQA/edit#gid=1677297587/index.html.md)
- [career plan template](https://performancemanager.successfactors.com/doc/po/develop_employee/carsample.html/index.html.md)

Managers should discuss career development at least once a month at the [1:1](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/leadership/1-1/index.html.md/index.html.md) and then support their team members with creating a plan to help them achieve their career goals.

There is also a way to practice foreign languages and ask for advice in several Slack channels, each dedicated to a specific language. You can find all these channels by searching for channels starting with #lang. If you're missing a channel for your target language, feel free to create one and mention it in #general so that fellow gitlabbers can join too!

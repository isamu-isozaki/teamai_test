## Idea/Problem Statement

Describe the idea or problem we need to implement or solve. Be concise, outline the benefits of doing
this and the risks of not doing it. Briefly provide one or more potential approaches.

## Design

Describe the chosen approach (i.e., its architecture, technology selection and other relevant design
information/index.html.md) to implement the idea or solve the problem. Be as specific as you think is necessary.

### Implementation Considerations

#### Testing

Outline how the solution will be tested.

#### GitLab.com and Self-managed

Describe how this solution is expected to work (or not/index.html.md) on both GitLab.com and self-managed.

### Operational Considerations

#### Automation

Outline the automation necessary to deploy and operate the designed solution. What metrics are
important? What alerts can we foresee? Is passive monitoring required?

####  Monitoring

Describe how the implemented solution will be monitored.

### Additional Considerations

List any additional considerations that may play a role in the design (for instance, licensing/index.html.md).

### Alternatives

If there are any alternatives which merited significant considerations, discuss them briefly.

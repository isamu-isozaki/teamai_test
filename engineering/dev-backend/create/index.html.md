### Create Team
{: #create}

The Create team is responsible for all backend aspects of the [Create stage of the DevOps lifecycle], 
which is all about creating code, and includes all functionality around source code management, 
code review (merge requests/index.html.md), the Web IDE, wikis, and snippets.

The 2019 product vision for Create is layed out in [this blog post].

## Plan Team

The Plan team works on the backend part of GitLab for the [Plan stage]. Among
other things, this means working on GitLab's issue tracker, integration with
external trackers, [Markdown rendering], [Elasticsearch integration], and email
notifications.

For more details about the vision for this area of the product, see the [Plan
stage] page.

## Work

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow]. To get in touch
with the Plan team, it's best to [create an issue] in the relevant project
(typically [GitLab CE]/index.html.md) and add the ~Plan label, along with any other
appropriate labels. Then, feel free to ping the relevant Product Manager and/or
Engineering Manager as listed above.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#g_plan] on Slack.

### Team meetings

Most of our team meetings are recorded and publicly available on Youtube in the
[Plan team playlist][youtube].

### Retrospectives

The Plan team conducts [monthly retrospectives in GitLab issues][retros]. These include
the backend team, plus any people from frontend, UX, and PM who have worked with
that team during the release being retrospected.

These are confidential during the initial discussion, then made public in time
for each month's [GitLab retrospective]. For more information, see [team
retrospectives].

The retrospective issue is created by a scheduled pipeline in the
[backend-retrospectives] project. For more information on how it works, see that
project's README.

### Functional group updates

Our [functional group updates][fgus] are public, published through GitLab
Pages. For more information, see the [functional group updates handbook page].

The source repository for these updates is [functional-group-updates]. The
README contains more information on how they are built.

### The due-22nd Label

The [due-22nd label]. This indicates issues that have a soft due-date of the
22nd of the month (two weeks after the kick-off on the 8th/index.html.md), as opposed to other
issues which can be completed at any time during the month. We are still
evaluating this label and its usage, but we hope to:

1. Help Product communicate priority outside boards, in a more granular way than
   the existing Deliverable and Stretch labels.
2. Force ourselves to ensure issues are scoped down appropriately.
3. Give everyone a clearer sense of the state of the milestone; if all of the
   due-22nd issues are still open on the 24th, for instance, then we are
   probably at risk of other issues slipping.

We are tracking its success, or otherwise, in a [retrospective follow-up issue].

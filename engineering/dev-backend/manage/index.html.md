### Manage
{: #welcome}

The responsibilities of this team are described by the [Manage product
category](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/categories/#manage/index.html.md). Among other things, this means 
working on GitLab's functionality around user, group and project administration, 
authentication, access control, and subscriptions.

Each team has a different focus on what issues to work on for each
release. The following information is not meant to be a set of hard-and-fast
rules, but as a guideline as to what team decides can best improve certain
areas of GitLab.

APIs should be shared responsibility between all teams within the
Backend group.

There is a backend group call every Tuesday, before the company call. You should
have been invited when you joined; if not, ask your team lead!

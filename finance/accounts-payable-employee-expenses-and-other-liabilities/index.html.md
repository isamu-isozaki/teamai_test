    * Unsuccessful exports typically result from an error related to NetSuite records. Each Expensify user must have a corresponding NetSuite Employee record and Vendor record.
    * Check NetSuite to verify if the employee in question has both a Vendor and Employee record.
    * If the records exist, add the employee‚Äôs email address to both records. In order for the export to work, this must be the same email address that is assigned to the employee within Expensify.
    * If the records do not exist, create both an Employee and Vendor record in NetSuite, complete with email addresses. Expensify uses the employee email address when mapping its records to that of NetSuite. The export will not work without proper alignment of email addresses in the NetSuite and Expensify records.

### Recording Employee Stock Option Expense

Employee stock options are recorded on a calendar quarterly basis. The puropse of this entry is to record the expense and allocate it between the appropriate departments.

1. Request a copy of the Carta report named "GitLab-Inc 20XX Equity Incentive Plan Grant Date Annual US GAAP Consolidated" from the CFO (the report should be in CSV/Excel format/index.html.md).
1. We will focus on the Expense Summary and Date tabs
1. On the Expense Summary tab, click on the journal entry amount to see column and tabs being referenced in the formula. 
    * This should be column AX of the Date tab, and this column will be used to allocate the total expense between departments.
1. Sort the columns on the Date tab and delete all rows with a zero balance 
1. Add a column to the Date tab with department information that corresponds to the employees referenced in column B (department information can be found in NetSuite/index.html.md).
1. Create a pivot table using the data from column AX and the department column created in the previous step.
    * The pivot table should provide the amount of stock option expense attributable to each department.
1. Check that the total amount of the pivot table matches the amount on the Expense Summary tab.
1. Proceed to NetSuite to create a journal entry that matches the Expense Summary tab.
1. Date the journal entry using the last day of the quarter being closed. 
1. The debit side of the entry uses GL "6077 Stock Compensation Expense" for all departments other than Cost of Sales which uses GL "5090 Stock Compensation Cost of Sales."
1. Be sure to fill in the Department attribute when adding lines to the journal entry.
1. The credit side of the entry only needs one line and uses GL "3015 Additional Paid in Capital- Stock Options"
1. Save the report used to calculate the journal entry and attach it to the entry within NetSuite.
1. Click Save and the entry is complete.

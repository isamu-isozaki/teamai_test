## Capital Assets Policy

#### Purpose
This policy establishes the minimum cost (capitalization amount/index.html.md) used to determine the capital assets recorded in GitLab's financial statements.

#### Capital Assets Defined

A â€œCapital Assetâ€ is a unit of property that has an economic useful life extending beyond 12 months **and** was acquired (or in some cases, produced/index.html.md) for a cost of [$1,000 (USD/index.html.md)](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/global-compensation/#exchange-rates/index.html.md) or more. Capital Assets must be capitalized and depreciated for financial reporting purposes.

#### Capitalization Thresholds

GitLab establishes [$1,000 (USD/index.html.md)](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/global-compensation/#exchange-rates/index.html.md) as the minimum amount required for capitalization. Any item with a cost below this amount or an economic useful life of 12 months or less, is expensed on the date of purchase.

#### Methodology 

All capital assets are recorded at historical cost as of the acquisition date. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the number of depreciation periods being determined by asset class.

* **Equipment:** For our purposes, equipment generally consists of computers and other related office tools. Equipment under our INC entity is assigned a standard useful life of three (3/index.html.md) years. However, equipment under our BV entity is depreciated over five (5/index.html.md) years due to Dutch tax laws, which limit depreciation of capitals assets to a maximum of 20% of the asset cost per year.

* **Furniture:** Furniture includes office furniture and other fixtures. The standard useful life for furniture is seven (7/index.html.md) years. This depreciation schedule applies to all entities.

Invoices and purchase receipts for capital assets are retained for a minimum of five years.

## Onboarding Processes

This page is a guide for People Ops when onboarding new team members. All onboarding tasks and guidelines for new team members are in the [People Ops Onboarding Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md).

PeopleOps needs, at minimum, 3 business days from when the offer/contract is signed by the candidate before they can start. All new hires should be scheduled to start on a Monday whenever possible. This will ensure a good candidate experience and that the new employee has all necessary equipment and proper access prior to starting.

### Git Going at GitLab (Day 1 and Day 2)

We (PeopleOps) are iterating on two orientation calls, called Git Going at GitLab. These are designed to help brand new GitLabbers find their way around in the first few days and covers (for now but more to come) Slack, enabling 2FA, 1Password, working with Google and the Handbook.  These should be arranged on the Monday and Tuesday of the first week

You can find the video of the Day 1 call here:

### Onboarding Issue Tasks

- **Select a Buddy**<a name="buddy"></a>
In the "Buddy Spreadsheet" google sheet, select a buddy for the new team member that is in the same timezone, but a different functional group. Try to pair a technical team member with a non-technical team member and vice versa. Remove the buddy from the spreadsheet, and add the new team member to the sheet so they can also be a buddy one day!
- **Add blank entry to team page**<a name="blank-entry"></a>
Login to [Gitlab.com](www.gitlab.com) and go to the www-gitlab-com project. In
the left menu click "Files," select "data," and choose the file called team.yml. In the top right
corner you can click "edit" to make edits to the code. Scroll all the way down
and copy-paste the code of the previous blank entry to the team page. Edit the
fields to the right info of the new hire and find the right job description URL on
the [Jobs](/jobs/) page. Do not include the employee's name in the commit message, only initials.
 **Note** _This can be tricky, so if you run into trouble reach out to some of
your awesome colleagues in the #questions (channel) on Slack_
- **Invite to swag store**<a name="printfection"></a>
Log in to [Printfection](https://www.printfection.com/). At the top of the home page, click "Campaigns", then scroll down to "Your Favorite Campaigns" and select "New Hire Swag". Go to External Orders and select invite users directly. Invite a new user using their GitLab email and grant them Limited Access. They will need to have this completed before being able to order any swag.
- **Add team member to Beamy**<a name="add-beamy"></a>
Login in to access the settings for the [Beam](https://suitabletech.com/accounts/login/). In the top menu move your cursor over the blue login button. Go to "Manage your beams". Click on "manage" in the lower left corner. Enter the GitLab email and scroll down to find the newly added email. Check the box for "Auto connect".
- **Add team member to Expensify (only with employees)**<a name="add-expensify"></a>
Log in to [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/signin) and go to "Settings" in the left sidebar. Select the right policy based upon the entity that employs the new team member. Select "People" in the left menu. Select "Invite" and add the GitLab email. Click "invite". If the team member should be added as an admin to be able to also add new team members, update them to a [domain admin](https://docs.expensify.com/advanced-admin-controls/domain-members-and-groups).
- **Add team member to our Egencia platform**<a name="add-egencia"></a>
Log into Egencia and go to the menu option "manage users". Choose "new user account" and fill in the passport name of the new team member. The username should be the new team member's email address. Enter the GitLab email address where asked and uncheck the newsletter box. Lastly assign the department in which the new team member is working.
- **Order business cards**<a name="business-cards"></a>
Go to BambooHR, find the team member, and click on "Business Cards" in the menu. Select "Update Business Card Requests" and fill out all the pertinent fields. Log in with your specific credentials to [Moo](https://www.moo.com/m4b/account/login). Under "Your Account", select "Go to your platform". Click "Create a new product", choose "Business Cards". If the new team member has both a GitLab and a Twitter handle, choose "GitLab 2 - Editable". If the new team member has only one handle, choose "GitLab - Editable". Click "Start Making". Click on the preview to edit the name, job title, email, phone number (formatted `+[country code] number`), social handle(s), and location. Once you have made sure all of the information is correct on the business card, click "Design Backs", "Edit Paper", choose "Super" paper, "Rounded" corners, and how many cards you would like to order (the standard is 50). Click "Review Design", "Save & Finish", and then add the cards to your cart. When you are checking out, update which shipping center you would like the cards sent from at the top right by selecting the proper flag. Enter in the team member's shipping address. Place the order with the applicable shipping and billing addresses.
- **Upgrade team member's Zoom account to Pro**<a name="make-zoom-pro"></a>
1. Log in to the People Ops [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us) account using the credentials stored in 1Password.
1. Click "My Account" in the top right corner.
1. On the left sidebar, under "User Management", click "Users".
1. In the search bar, search for the team member's name (sometimes you may have to search for their email address instead). If the user does not appear yet in Zoom, you can double check with them that they created their Zoom account using their GitLab email address, or you can add them manually by clicking "Add Users" button at the top of the User Management tab.
1. Under "Type", confirm if they have a Pro account. If it says "Basic", click on "Edit" and choose "Pro" and save.
1. If you receive an error, this means we need to purchase more Zoom Pro licenses. This can be done by People Ops by sending an email to our account manager at Zoom, as listed in a shared note on 1Password. The turnaround time is typically 2-3 business days for the new licenses to become activated.
1. Click on their email address.
1. Where it says "Personal Link" click "Customize" and type `gitlab.firstnamelastname` and click "Save Changes". (Please keep in mind that Zoom only accepts the English alphabet.)
1. The Pro account and personal Zoom room is now active!

## Ordering Supplies

If a GitLabber is in need of supplies and is unable to purchase the items themselves, People Ops can place the order, per [Spending Company Money](/handbook/spending-company-money/).

Use the Amazon business account for all Amazon links. In order to see what is available to ship in each country use that country's Amazon website to sign in, place the order, and ship.

For Apple products we have a relationship with Bay Street Business to place all orders and act as our liaison.
* For orders in the US, first check to see if there is a computer that can be shipped from the GitLab boardroom. To track available computers take a look at the shared "Laptop Check-in/Check-out" google doc. To send a computer to a new team member send an email to the Executive Assistant; include name, shipping information, what type of laptop is needed, and by what date.
* If there is not a computer available for a team member in the US, login to the [custom store](https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/login.html?appIdKey=a747eeda10429061323c0b5d14a4937fe24fde503ea79cf9cf72a09b0d8f2434&path=/asb2b/init.do%3Fsegment%3DDFL-SEG&language=US-EN&segment=DFL-SEG) to place the order and ship.
* For orders outside the US, but in a country with an Apple Store, please contact Bay Street Business (baystreetbusiness@apple.com) to coordinate with the local store and generate the invoice. Once the invoice is made, it will be sent to People Ops via email. If all information looks correct, contact Bay Street Business with the payment information.

After an order has been placed or a laptop has been shipped, update Finance and BambooHR via [asset tracking](/handbook/finance/asset-tracking/).

## Consolidated invoices

* In case we worked extra for the development, we create new invoice with extra amount

* In case we worked less, we issue a credit invoice for the reminder

It is preferred to avoid both the above cases (extra work for us/index.html.md)

## Using Recurly to invoice hourly clients (or special order/index.html.md) by credit card

* For an existing client you can skip the first two steps

* We create an account for the customer on Recurly

* We email them a link to their hosted account management page to enter billing information

* We open the customerâ€™s account and click the Add Charge button in the Charges and Credits section

* Enter the unit amount and any other relevant details, then click the Add Charge button (itâ€™s a good rule of thumb to include a description with the charge. The description will display with the line item on the customerâ€™s invoice/index.html.md)

* Keep the â€œCollect Sales Taxâ€ button checked; Type: Digital Product

* This will create an uninvoiced charge on the customerâ€™s account. By default, this charge will be automatically rolled into the customerâ€™s next subscription renewal invoice. If youâ€™d like to collect this charge immediately, click the Generate Invoice button on the customerâ€™s main account page

* Customer notes:

1. Non-EU clients: No VAT according to article 44 and 59 of the European VAT Directive

1. For EU clients: VAT shifted to recipient according to article 44 and 196 of the European VAT Directive

1. Dutch clients: leave blank

* Review the invoice details and click the Post Invoice button

* Once the invoice is posted, Recurly will automatically collect on the invoice during our next automatic bill run (typically at the top of every hour/index.html.md). You will see the accountâ€™s balance go back to $0.00 when this charge is successfully processed

## Customer wants to update their Recurly account or billing information

1. Each Recurly account has a hosted account page where they can manage their information. The link is in Recurly -> accounts -> account name -> Hosted pages information.

1. Use the Hosted Account Management URL to go directly to the page without logging in.

You can find additional documentation [here](https://docs.recurly.com/hosted-account-management/index.html.md).

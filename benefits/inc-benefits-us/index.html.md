## Specific to US based employees
{: #us-specific-benefits}

US based employees' benefits are arranged through [Lumity](https://lumity.com/index.html.md/index.html.md). The benefits decision discussions are held by People Operations, the CFO, and the CEO to elect the next year's benefits by the carrier's deadlines. People Operations will notify the team of open enrollment as soon as details become available.    

If you have any questions regarding benefits please reach out to People Operations directly. If you have any questions with the Lumity platform, feel free to reach out to their support personnel at `support@lumity.com`.

Carrier ID cards are normally received within weeks of submitting your benefit elections. If you or your medical providers are in need of immediate confirmation of your coverage, please contact the carrier directly.

GitLab covers **100% of employee contributions and 66% for employee's spouse, dependents, and/or domestic partner** of premiums for medical, dental, and vision coverage. Plan rates are locked through December 31, 2019.

More information on the processed deductions in payroll from Lumity can be found in the [Finance handbook](https://about.gitlab.comhttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/finance/processing-payroll/#lumity-payroll-processes-for-gitlab-inc/index.html.md).

## Open Enrollment

If you are a new hire between now and October 1st, you will need to enroll in TriNet's benefits to cover you through September 30th as well as Lumity's benefits to begin coverage in October. The People Operations Analyst will reach out to you with more details.

In December 2018, there will be a passive open enrollment for the plan year 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31. If you would like an FSA for the 2019 calendar year you **must** actively elect this during the December open enrollment period. If you would like a different plan starting January 1, you may elect that plan in December, but if you do not want any changes, your coverages will stay the same.  

GitLab held a 101 with Lumity around open enrollment:

## Group Medical Coverage

GitLab offers plans from United Health Care for all states within the US as well as additional Kaiser options for residents of California, Hawaii, and Colorado. Deductibles will run 2018-10-01 to 2018-12-31 and reset 2019-01-01 for a plan year of 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.  

For additional information on how [Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPVS1aOFdRdXRSVzZ5Z3B0dEVKUXJIWm1zZXRj/view?usp=sharing/index.html.md) or [HSAs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPbUo1VFNFVFlQNlUyV0xQZkE0YXQyZENSNU1j/view?usp=sharing/index.html.md) operate, please check out the documentation on the Google Drive or Lumity's [resources](https://employee-resources.lumity.com/help/index.html.md).

_If you already have current group medical coverage, you may choose to waive or
opt out of TriNet's group health benefits. If you choose to waive health coverage,
you will receive a $300.00 monthly benefit allowance and will still be able to
enroll in dental, vision, optional plans, and flexible spending accounts._

If you do not enroll in a plan within your benefits election period, you will automatically receive the medical waiver allowance.

As part of this mandate, medical carriers were given time to review their current policies and update to reflect the mandate. Because there is a wide range of services, treatment, and goals for transgender patients, employees are encouraged to contact their carrier directly to have these discussions.

### Pregnancy & Maternity Care

With medical plans, GitLab offers pregnancy and maternity care. Depending on the plan you selected, your coverages may differ for in-network vs out-of-network, visits, and inpatient care. Please contact Lumity or People Operations with any questions about your plan.

## GitLab Inc. United States Leave Policy:

Based on the Family and Medical Leave Act, or [FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.html.md/index.html.md), US Employees are "eligible to take job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave." For more information on what defines an eligible employee and medical reason please visit the [Electronic Code of Federal Regulation](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=d178a2522c85f1f401ed3f3740984fed&rgn=div5&view=text&node=29:3.1.1.3.54&idno=29#sp29.3.825.b/index.html.md) for the most up to date data.

### Apply For Parental Leave in the US

1. The employee will fill out the [Extended Leave Request Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gitlab.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPdzhITFI2VDR2TVAxS2N6ZUlkVzZveTBWSkVR/view?usp=sharing/index.html.md) at least thirty days before the start of the leave and email the form to People Ops.
  * The reason for leave is "Maternity/pregnancy-related medical condition and/or to bond with a new child."  
  * If you would like your payroll deductions to continue to be deducted on each paycheck, select "I have made other arrangements with my Company."
1. Once the Extended Leave Request form has been submitted and approved by People Ops, it will then be entered into TriNet by People Ops.
  * Go to Passport under Find > Find Person by Name > Pull the employee up > Extended Leave Request.
  * Enter all applicable information.
  * If the employee is eligible for 100% of pay, make sure to note in the request â€œleave with payâ€ status for the employee.
  * Once the leave is in TriNet it takes the LOA department about 5 business days to process the request.
1. Once the Leave of Absence request has been approved through TriNet, GitLab will be notified via email with the Initial Notification letter which confirms the Extended Leave of Absence, the FMLA Notice, Designation, and Exhaust Notice Letters. These should be filed in BambooHR in the Benefits folder.
1. People Operations will forward the letters from TriNet via email to the employee.
  * If this is for a maternity leave, People Operations will explain the process for the employee to file for Short Term Disability (STD/index.html.md). [Short-Term Disability](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/#short-and-long-term-disability-insurance/index.html.md) is processed through Aetna. If the employee is eligible for state STD, Aetna will advise on how to file. Provide the employee with Aetna's phone number and plan number, which can be found in the People Ops 1Password vault.
1. Once the employee has filed a claim for STD, they will need to confirm the start and end dates of the STD.
  * The typical pay for STD is six weeks for a vaginal birth and eight weeks for a c-section. STD can be extended if the employee has a pregnancy related complication (bed rest, complications from delivery, etc/index.html.md).
1. People Operations will confirm [payroll details](#payroll-processing-during-parental-leave/index.html.md) with the Controller.   
1. The employee will notify People Operations on their first day back to work.
1. People Operations will submit the return to work request in TriNet.
  * In the Beta site click on your Admin View at the top right.
  * Then in the menu to the left choose Employees > Manage Employees.  
  * Search and click on the employee returning from leave.  
  * Then click the Return from Leave button at the top right.  
  * Input all details and submit.  
  * Verify if a special payroll needs to be created for any days that were not paid if a payroll has already been processed. (Only applicable if the employee was not eligible for 100% of the wages throughout leave/index.html.md).

### Payroll Processing During Parental Leave

**Paternity Leave**
Paternity Leave is not covered under Short Term Disability, so if the employee is eligible for 100% of pay, payroll would enter 100% of the pay period hours under "Leave with Pay."   

**Maternity Leave**
For maternity leave, GitLab will verify 100% of the wages are paid for eligible employees through TriNet's payroll and Short-term Disability (STD/index.html.md).

1. While the employee is on short-term disability (which covers 66.7%/index.html.md), GitLab will supplement the remaining 33.3% through TriNet's payroll.
  * The employee will inform People Operations when their short term disability is set to begin and end.
  * There is a seven day elimination period for short term disability that is not paid through Aetna, where GitLab will need to supplement the entire wage through payroll.
    * For instance, if Aetna has approved STD for January 1 - February 12, January 1 - January 7 would not be paid through STD.
    * If any adjustments need to be made to a payroll that has already passed, People Ops will send an email with the employee's name and number of hours to be paid to the TriNet payroll contact (found in the People Ops 1Password vault/index.html.md).    
  * For the days the employee is paid through STD, payroll will adjust leave with pay hours to equal 33.3% and leave without pay hours to equal 66.7%.
    * For example, if there are 80 hours in the pay period you would input 26.66 hours Leave with Pay / 53.34 Leave without Pay.
1. When short-term disability ends, payroll will need to have 100% of the hours fall under leave with pay.

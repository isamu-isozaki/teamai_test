## Specific to Employees Based in Germany

Currently, GitLab does not provide any additional benefits over and above the mandatory state requirements. As part of the [guiding principles](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/#guiding-principles/index.html.md) this will be reviewed.

## Compulsory Social Security Contributions

GitLab and employee contributions to pension, health insurance, care in old age insurance and unemployment insurance are mandatory, as required by the state system. The payments are calculated each month by payroll and are shown on the employee pay-slips.

The rates (valid as of January 1, 2018/index.html.md) are as follows:

|Type of Insurance | Contribution by GitLab | Contribution by Employee|

## GitLab GmbH Germany Leave Policy

To apply for a parental leave, please send a letter to People Ops confirming the dates. People Ops will file the letter in BambooHR and forward to our German payroll provider to process.

**Maternity Protection**
Maternity protection is explained in the Maternity Protection Act (Mutterschutzgesetz/index.html.md). Generally, 6 weeks before the estimated date of birth and 8 weeks after the date of birth the pregnant employee is released from work. This period can differ in case of special circumstances (twins, preterm birth/index.html.md). The employee will receive full payment of her salaries from the employer. The employer receives a refund of these amounts through an application process with the state.

**Parental Leave**
An employee is entitled to parental leave until the child turns three. The employee is not obliged to work during this period and no payment is due by the employer. Parental leave can be taken by the mother and father, individually or jointly.

Parental allowance is a state benefit for parents who would like to look after the child themselves after the birth, and therefore are not in full-time work or are not working at all. If mothers and fathers share the parental allowance, they receive parental allowance for a maximum of 14 months. Each parent can draw a minimum of two and a maximum of twelve months' parental allowance. Lone parents are entitled to the full 14 months' parental allowance.

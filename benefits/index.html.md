## Guiding Principles

These principles will guide our benefit strategies and decisions.

* **Collaboration**
  - Work with providers, vendors, and global networks to benchmark benefit data from other similar sized companies.
  - Foster cross-company understanding.
* **Results**
  - Evangelize benefit programs in each entity.
  - Transform â€œstatutoryâ€ to â€œcompetitive.â€
  - Make benefits a very real aspect of compensation during the hiring process.
  - Measure employee engagement and benefit enrollment.
* **Efficiency**
  - Use the GitLab Inc (US/index.html.md) benefits as a starting point, and try to stay as consistent as possible within the US baseline.
  - Iterate on changes for specific countries based on common practices and statutory regulations.
* **Diversity**
  - Actively work to ensure that our benefit choices are inclusive of all team members.
* **Iteration**
  - Regularly review current benefits (bi-annually/index.html.md) and propose changes.
  - Everything is always in draft.
* **Transparency**
  - Announce and document benefits to keep them updated.
  - Share upcoming benefit plans internally before implementing them.
  - Invite discussion and feedback.

We value opinions but ultimately People Operations/Leadership will make the decision based on expert advice and data.

## General Benefits

For the avoidance of doubt, the benefits listed below in the General Benefits section are available to contractors and employees, unless otherwise stated. Other benefits are listed by countries that GitLab has established an entity or co-employer and therefore are applicable to employees in those countries only. GitLab has also made provisions for Parental Leave which may apply to employees and contractors but this may vary depending on local country laws. If you are unsure please reach out to the People Operations team.

1. GitLab will pay for the items listed under [spending company money](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/spending-company-money/index.html.md).
1. [Stock options](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/stock-options/index.html.md/index.html.md) are offered to most GitLabbers.
1.  Deceased team member:
    In the unfortunate event that a GitLab team member passes away, GitLab will
    provide a [$20,000](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/global-compensation/#exchange-rates/index.html.md) lump sum to anyone of their choosing. This can be a spouse,
    partner, family member, friend, or charity.
      * For US based employees of GitLab Inc., this benefit is replaced by the
        [Basic Life Insurance](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/inc-benefits-us/#basic-life-insurance-and-add/index.html.md) that is offered through TriNet.
      * For all other GitLabbers, the following conditions apply:
         * The team member must be either an employee or direct contractor.
         * The team member must have indicated in writing to whom the money
           should be transferred. To do this you must complete this [expression of wishes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBX6Mn5JhYuQpCXgM4mkx1BbTit59l0hD2WQiY7Or9E/edit?usp=sharing/index.html.md) form, email to People Ops, who will then file in BambooHR.
         * For part-time GitLabbers, the lump sum is calculated pro-rata, so
           for example for a team member that works for GitLab 50% of the time,
           the lump sum would be [$10,000](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/people-operations/global-compensation/#exchange-rates/index.html.md).
1. [Paid time off policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/paid-time-off/index.html.md)

It is important to spend time face to face to get to know your team and, if possible, meet everyone who has also bought into the company vision. There are fun activities planned by our GitLab Summit Experts, work time, and presentations from different functional groups to make this an experience that you are unlikely to forget! Attendance is optional, but encouraged. For more information and compilations of our past summits check out our [summits page](/culture/summits/index.html.md).

## Parental Leave

Anyone (regardless of gender/index.html.md) at GitLab who becomes a parent through childbirth or adoption is able to take fully paid parental leave. GitLabbers will be encouraged to decide for themselves the appropriate amount of time to take and how to take it. We will offer everyone who has been at GitLab for a year up to 12 weeks of 100% paid time off during the first year of parenthood. We encourage parents to take 8-12 weeks.

For many reasons, a team member may require more time off for parental leave. Many GitLabbers are from countries that have longer standard parental leaves, occasionally births have complications, and sometimes 12 weeks just isn't enough. Any GitLabber can request additional unpaid parental leave, up to 4 weeks. We are happy to address anyone with additional leave requests on a one-on-one basis. All of the parental leave should be taken in the first year.

If you have been at GitLab for a year your parental leave is fully paid. If you've been at GitLab for less than a year it depends on your jurisdiction.

You are entitled to and need to comply with your local regulations. They override our policy.

**How to Apply for Parental Leave**

1. To initiate your parental leave, please send an email to People Ops and your manager at least thirty days before your leave will begin, and also take a look at the process for application based on your employment company Country Specific Leave Requirements, which are subject to change as legal requirements change:
  * [GitLab Inc. United States Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/inc-benefits-us/#gitlab-inc-united-states-leave-policy/index.html.md)
  * [GitLab Inc. China Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/inc-benefits-china/#gitlab-inc-china-leave-policy/index.html.md)
  * [GitLab B.V. Netherlands Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/bv-benefits-netherlands/#gitlab-bv-netherlands-leave-policy/index.html.md)
  * [GitLab B.V. Belgium Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/bv-benefits-belgium/#gitlab-bv-belgium-leave-policy/index.html.md)
  * [GitLab B.V. India Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/lyra-benefits-india/#gitlab-bv-india-leave-policy/index.html.md)
  * [GitLab LTD United Kingdom Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/ltd-benefits-uk/#gitlab-ltd-united-kingdom-leave-policy/index.html.md)
  * [GitLab GmbH Germany Leave Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/benefits/gmbh-benefits-germany/#gitlab-gmbh-germany-leave-policy/index.html.md)
1. People Ops will log and monitor upcoming parental leave in the "Parental Leave" google sheet on the drive.
1. Once the leave is official, People Ops will file all documentation in BambooHR and update the status of the team member to "Parental Leave" in Employment Status table. The date entered is the date the team member started leave. An additional entry should be made with the date the team member will return with the status "Active."
  * This will generate an email to People Ops to remind them to end the leave in any applicable payroll systems.

If you need any additional leave, please refer to our [Paid Time Off Policy](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/paid-time-off/index.html.md).

Only C-level executives can sign legal documents, with the exception of NDAs covering a physical visit of another organization.
When working with legal agreements with vendors, consultants, and so forth, bear in mind the [signature authorization matrix](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/finance/authorization-matrix/index.html.md/index.html.md).
If you need to sign, fill out, send, or retrieve documents electronically, please send a description of what you need or a copy of the document to legal@gitlab.com with the following information:

1. Names and email addresses of those who need to sign the document.
1. Any contractual information that needs to be included in the document.
1. Deadline (or preferred timeline/index.html.md) by which you need the document prepared (i.e. staged in [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/index.html.md) for relevant signatures/index.html.md)
1. Names and email addresses of those who need to be cc-ed on the signed document.

The process that Legal will follow is:

1. Review the document and prepare as requested.
1. Have the requestor check the prepared document, AND obtain approval from the CFO or CEO (such approval may be explicit in the email thread that was sent to `legal@`, in which case a second approval is not needed unless there have been significant edits to the document/index.html.md).
1. Requestor shall stage the document for signing in HelloSign and cc (at minimum/index.html.md) `legal@`.
1. Once signed, for customer contracts, the Requestor shall attach the document to the applicable Contracts Object in Salesforce, and fill out all applicable fields in the Contracts Object, for vendor agreements, Legal will file the document in the applicable contracts folder on Google Drive.

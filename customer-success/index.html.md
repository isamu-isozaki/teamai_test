Need to focus on 3 main areas in order to grow in our existing accounts as well as land large and strategic:

## Transition and Handoff Workflow

In an effort to capture the wider scope of customer interactions with GitLab, the flow outlined below will soon addresses the business processes involved through the entire service lifecycle and customer journey.  There is an active initiative to unify stages, phases, titles, names, etc led by Marketing and Sales.

## Responsibility Matrix and Transitions

The table below depicts the relationships between activities, responsible roles, relationship and opportunity stages in the customer lifecycle.  A more detailed in the [responsibility assignment matrix (RACI/index.html.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix/index.html.md) format will be an critical tool for every GitLab customer.

## Customer Success Data Management

Customer names, customer information security and NDA compliance are critical concerns for Customer Success, since we communicate with customers every day. All issues managing work as it relates to prospects and customers must be private and confidential. Work should be managed only in approved GitLab projects and never within private repositories. GitLab employee-only accessible projects for work management include:

* [us-public-sector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/us-public-sector/index.html.md) parent project for all public sector work
* [account-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/index.html.md/index.html.md) parent project for account-specific work and collaboration with the rest of sales
* [customer-success](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/index.html.md) parent project for Customer Success employee, shared or triage work

### Customer Success & Market Segmentation
For definitions of the account size, refer to [market segmentation](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/sales#market-segmentation/index.html.md) which is based on the _Potential EE Users_ field on the account.

- Strategic: Sr. Account Executive closed deal and stays on account for growth and renewal.  Solutions Architect is assigned pre-sales and stays on the account to help with adoption and growth.
- Large: Sr. Account Executive closed deal and stays on account for growth and renewal.  Solutions Architect is assigned pre-sales and stays on the account to help with adoption and growth.
- Mid-Market: Account Executive closes deal and transfers to Account Manager to handle renewals and growth. The Account Manager records the Previous Account Owner on the Opportunity Group in any deals while the account is in the New Customer period within the first 12 months including the first annual renewal.
- SMB: Web Portal with Sales Admin oversight.

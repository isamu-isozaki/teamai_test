# Implementation Engineering Handbook
{:.no_toc}

The Implementation Engineering group at GitLab is a part of the [Customer Success](/handbook/customer-success) department. Implementation Engineers have the goal to optimize organization's adoption of GitLab through our implementation services, designed to enable other necessary systems in your environment so that customers can move from planning to monitoring.

## Role & Responsibilities
See the [Implementation Engineer role description](/job-families/sales/implementation-engineer/)

### Statement of Work creation

The GitLab Implementation Engineering group is responsible for both maintaining the [GitLab SOW Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8_EiX8kgJdpaVlydbTJg5pn4RXeDvYOIyok2G1A69I/edit) (internal link) as well as the production of new Statements of Work for customer proposals.

To obtain a Statement of Work, open a new SOW issue using the template on the [Professional Services project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services/issues/new?issuable_template=SOW%20Request) (internal link). 
We prefer customers to mark up our agreement and SOW template if they request changes. If they require the use of their services terms or SOW, please contact the Implementation Engineering group.

### Services Delivery

#### Implementation Plan

Each services engagement will include an Implementation Plan compiled based on the Statement of Work and other discussions the Implementation Engineering group has with the customer.  The Implementation Engineering group also maintains the SOW template located [at this internal link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ohZtqR1mMZYWAOD7PBVc1xZIMGpzHNgccRxVZ9Nzirg/edit).

## How to work with/in the Implementation Engineering group

### Contacting & Scheduling

At GitLab, Implementation Engineering is part of the [Customer Success department](/handbook/customer-success).  As such, you can engage with Implementation Engineering by following the guidelines for [engaging with any Solutions Architect](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects#when-and-how-to-engage-a-solutions-architect).  This process ensures that the Customer Success department as a whole can understand the inbound needs of the account executive and our customers.

For scheduling specific customer engagements, we currently are slotting implementations while our group grows to support the demand for services.  If you have a concern about scheduling the engagement, this should be discussed at the Discovery phase.  In no case should you commit to dates before receipt of agreements, P.O., etc.

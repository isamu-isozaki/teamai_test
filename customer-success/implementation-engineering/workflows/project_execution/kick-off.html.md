The kick-off may be handled as part of the [Welcome to GitLab call](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/customer-success/tam/#where-does-a-technical-account-manager-fit-in/index.html.md) orchestrated by the GitLab Technical Account Manager.  However, many times the implementation kick off will be an on-site engagement or one handled directly by the Implementation Engineer.  This template is for use in those cases.

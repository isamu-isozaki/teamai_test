After the SOW has been completed, the customer will need to sign a Project sign off document.  This should be sent by the TAM or the IE involved, and then forwarded to Finance as part of the [financial-wrapup workflow](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/customer-success/implmentation-engineering/workflows/internal/financial-wrapup.html/index.html.md).

To send a Project Sign off document:

1. Go to the Professional Services opportunity for the SOW you are going to get sign off for.
2. Go to the Notes and Attachments section of the Opportunity.
3. Confirm there is a signed Statement of Work. If not, please reach out to the Sales rep who closed the deal and ask them to upload the signed SOW.
4. Go to the associated quote record under the "Quotes section"
5. Click on the Quote that was "Sent to Z-Billing"
6. Click on the "Sertifi eSign" button
7. In the "Email Invite Message" field, enter a quick message to the signer.
 

```
Dear [signer],

Attached please find the sign off documentation for your GitLab Professional Services Statement of Work. 
You should be able to sign this document electronically. 
If you have any issues or questions, please free to reach out to me at boleary@gitlab.com.

Thank you,
Brendan O'Leary
Manager, Professional Services

## Value sell for Profesional Services

### Elevator Pitch

**The Problem - Customer Perspective**

The customer has decided that GitLab is their tool of choice going forward, but has concerns about realizing the value of GitLab quickly and seamlessly.  These concerns can be in various areas:

* Lack of subject matter expertise on the GitLab technology stack
* Lack of adequate resources to promptly stand up GitLab
* Lack of sufficient resources to stand up GitLab in a highly-available or geographically dispersed way
* Concern around a large number of users coming off of legacy systems
* Concerns about change management for new processes
* Lack of confidence in the ability to deliver on the transformative promise of adopting "all" of GitLab

**Solution**

GitLab Professional Services helps organizations reduce time to market by accelerating the adoption of modern software delivery methods.

### Short Message

"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" - and this is particularly true in modern software development. GitLab enables all aspects intrinsic to software delivery, and we provide specialized training in these practices, such as CI/CD, version control, metrics, and more.

## Selling services workflow

1. Sales to introduce early in discussions
1. SA (or TAM where no SA/index.html.md) can do basic scoping and use [calculator](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/customer-success/implementation-engineering/selling/#services-calculator/index.html.md) for estimate
  - This should be good enough to secure budget
  - Customer should execute Subscription Agreement AND Consulting Services Agreement
1. If customer/prospect is ready to consume services; SA (or TAM/index.html.md) [opens Issue in Services project](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/customer-success/implementation-engineering/#implementation-engineering-issue-board/index.html.md) to request an IE
1. [IE conducts more detailed scoping call (if needed/index.html.md) to prepare SoW](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/customer-success/implementation-engineering/#statement-of-work-creation/index.html.md)
1. [SoW delivered and executed](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/customer-success/implementation-engineering/workflows/index.html.md/index.html.md)
1. Services fulfilled

### Data Sheets

Professional Services Data Sheets are available as subpages to the marketing site.  You can find them by visiting [https://about.gitlab.com/services](/services/index.html.md). 

## Services Calculator

The goal of the services calculator is to provide the sales team with the ability to self-serve and create a ROM package for a customer with the minimal amount of information.  You can get access to the service calculator [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fnVUVAc0azL1vzS2F67vod_ke1IS46jdHv0B3H1L6CM/edit/index.html.md).

## FAQ

#### Do we have set SKUs I can use?

Our customer's needs vary greatly depending on their experience with GitLab, their current business practices, and where they fall on their journey along the [DevOps Maturity Model](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/devops-maturity-model/index.html.md).

As such, our Implementation Engineering group has some package options that give a general [ROM](https://cso.nasa.gov/content/roms/index.html.md) cost figure for the scope of engagement but can customize those packages based on the customer's need.  The best way to elicit this would be a discovery call with the customer.  However, you can use the [services calculator](#services-calculator/index.html.md) above to get a rough order of magnitude as well.

Any discounts will need approval from Director of Customer Success.

#### What are our daily or hourly rates?

We do not currently have an hourly or daily rate.  Nor do we plan to have an hourly rate.  Just as with GitLab support, the mission of our Implementation Engineering group is not to bill hours, but to achieve success for our Customers.  So just as we don't offer support by the call or by the hour, we do not offer Professional Services by the day or the hour.

In the future, we may have a daily rate or a daily rate for on-site support.  However, we currently do not for the same reasons listed above.

#### What if the customer only wants training?

If the customer is an EE customer, we can offer training.  However, training will need to be scoped out by the customer success department before quoting a price.  The account executive will also be required to provide the use case for the need for just training.  Example use case might be: Customer is under license utilization and we need to prevent churn, help expand usage into additional groups and other business units.

#### What options exist for CE Customers?

GitLab CE is ideal for personal projects or small groups with minimal user management and workflow control needs.  Because these groups don't typically need a lot of focus on scaled implementation or training, we currently do not offer implementation, integration or training services to our CE customers.  Many of our [partners](/resellers/index.html.md/index.html.md) offer such services.  However, we find that many customers who have been running a CE instance and are looking to transition to a scaled implementation of GitLab may require a [Discovery Engagement](#discovery-engagement/index.html.md) to determine the customer's long-term needs.

If a customer is upgrading from CE to EE, Professional Services should be engaged to scope out the requirements for the transition if the customer will need services in the transition.

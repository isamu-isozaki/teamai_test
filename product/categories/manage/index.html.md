### Manage
{: #welcome}

The responsibilities of this team are described by the [Manage product
category](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/categories/#manage/index.html.md). Among other things, this means 
working on GitLab's functionality around user, group and project administration, 
authentication, access control, and subscriptions.

* I have a question. Who do I ask?

In GitLab issues, questions should start by @ mentioning the Product Manager for the [Manage product
category](https://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/product/categories/#dev/index.html.md). GitLabbers can also use [#g_manage](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CBFCUM0RX/index.html.md).

### How we work

* In accordance with our [GitLab values](https://about.gitlab.comhttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/values/index.html.md/index.html.md)
* Transparently: nearly everything is public, we record/livestream meetings whenever possible
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on
* Everyone can contribute; no silos

#### Planning

We plan in monthly cycles in accordance with our [Product Development Timeline](https://about.gitlab.comhttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline/index.html.md). 
Release scope for an upcoming release should be finalized by the `1st`.

To scope the release, Product is responsible for maintaining a prioritized list of issues. We use
[this prioritization board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/759099?=&label_name[]=Manage&label_name[]=backend/index.html.md) 
as the SSOT. Issues are tagged with the "prioritized" label and stack-ranked in the respective column. We use the following timeline:

* On or around the `24th`: Product meets with Engineering Managers for a preliminary issue review. Issues are tagged with a milestone.
* On or around the `28th`: Product takes the reviewed scope to the larger team for discussion. This becomes the release scope for the next release.
* On or around the `6th`: Product meets with Engineering Managers for a pre-kickoff check-in.

#### During the release

Developers will start the release with assigned issues. If a developer has completed work on an issue, 
they may open the [prioritization board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/683524?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Manage&label_name[]=prioritized/index.html.md) 
and begin working on the next prioritized issue. Issues should be worked on in priority order 
(the "prioritized" column will always be sorted by descending priority; the issue at the top is most important/index.html.md).

#### Retrospectives

After the `8th`, the Manage team conducts an [asynchronous retrospective](https://about.gitlab.comhttps://github.com/isamu-isozaki/teamai_test/tree/master/engineering/management/team-retrospectives/index.html.md/index.html.md). You can find current and past retrospectives for Manage in [https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/manage/issues/](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/manage/issues/index.html.md/index.html.md).
